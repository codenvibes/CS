## Getting Started

While it's not required, ideally, you should have a general understanding of OSI Model [Layer 2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_link_layer) (L2) [network switches](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_switch) work, what a [MAC table](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MAC_table) is, what the Address Resolution Protocol ([ARP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Address_Resolution_Protocol)) does, and how to use Wireshark at a basic level. If you're not comfortable with these topics, please check out the [Network](https://tryhackme.com/module/network-fundamentals) and [Linux](https://tryhackme.com/module/linux-fundamentals) Fundamentals modules and [Wireshark](https://tryhackme.com/room/wireshark) room. ^00a9fa

> **“L2”** means **Layer 2**  
> This refers to the **Data Link Layer** of the OSI model. At this layer, devices communicate using **MAC addresses** (hardware addresses).

### MAC Flooding

==DEF-MAC Flooding is an attack where an attacker floods a network switch with a large number of fake MAC addresses.==

**Why it works:**  
A switch uses a **MAC address table (CAM table)** to remember which MAC addresses are reachable on which physical ports. When the table is full, the switch can’t keep track anymore.

**Result:**  
The switch acts like a hub — it sends all traffic to all ports. This allows the attacker to **sniff network traffic** that wasn’t meant for them.
<div align="center">

<br>
</div>

### ARP Spoofing

ARP stands for **Address Resolution Protocol**. It maps IP addresses to MAC addresses inside a local network.

==DEF-ARP Spoofing (or ARP Poisoning) is a network attack where an attacker sends **forged ARP (Address Resolution Protocol) messages** onto a local area network (LAN) to **associate their MAC address with the IP address of another device**, like the default gateway or another host.==

**How the attack works:**  
An attacker sends fake ARP messages on the network. For example, they can say: _“Hey everyone, the gateway’s IP address is actually my MAC address!”_  
Devices believe it — so they send their traffic to the attacker instead of the real router.

**Result:**  
The attacker performs a **Man-in-the-Middle (MITM)** attack. They can:
- Read network traffic
- Modify it
- Steal credentials, cookies, etc.
<div align="center">
<br>
<br>
</div>

### How they work together

In practice:
- **MAC Flooding** is used to make the switch forward all packets to all ports.
- **ARP Spoofing** poisons the network’s IP-MAC relationships so traffic is rerouted through the attacker’s machine.

Both techniques help attackers sniff or manipulate network data inside a **local network** (like a LAN).

## Initial Access

_For the sake of this room, let's assume the following:_

While conducting a pentest, you have gained initial access to a network and escalated privileges to root on a Linux machine. During your routine OS enumeration, you realize it's a [dual-homed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dual-homed) host, meaning it is connected to two (or more) networks. Being the curious hacker you are, you decided to explore this network to see if you can move laterally.

After having established **persistence**, you can access the compromised host via **SSH**:

| **User** | **Password** | **IP**       | **Port** |
| -------- | ------------ | ------------ | -------- |
| admin    | Layer2       | 10.10.244.13 | 22       |

`ssh -o StrictHostKeyChecking=accept-new admin@10.10.244.13`

Note: The **admin** user is in the **sudo** group. I suggest using the **root** user to complete this room: `sudo su -`

### Questions

## Network Discovery

As mentioned previously, the host is connected to one or more additional networks. You are currently connected to the machine via SSH on Ethernet adapter **eth0**. The network of interest is connected with Ethernet adapter **eth1**.

First, have a look at the adapter:  

`ip address show eth1` or the shorthand version: `ip a s eth1`

Using this knowledge, answer questions **#1** and **#2**.

Now, use the network enumeration tool of your choice, e.g., **ping**, a bash or python script, or Nmap (pre-installed) to discover other hosts in the network and answer question **#3**.

### Questions

## Passive Network Sniffing

Simply scanning those hosts won't help us gather any useful information, and you may be asking, what could a pentester do in this situation? Depending on the **rules of engagement** and **scope**, you could try **sniffing** traffic on this network.

The diagram below describes your current situation where you are the **Attacker** and have persistent access to **eve.**

![](https://tryhackme-images.s3.amazonaws.com/user-uploads/5e9955140ab79a04b28162eb/room-content/f19dfb6c3e6771ba582f1994ca54648a.png)  

Let's try running **tcpdump** on the **eth1** network interface:

`tcpdump -i eth1`

Optionally, for a more verbose output that prints each packet (minus its link level header) in ASCII format:

`tcpdump -A -i eth1   `

Try to answer questions **#1** through **#2**.  

Now, let's take a closer look at the captured packets! We can redirect them into a **pcap** file providing a destination file via the **-w** argument:

`tcpdump -A -i eth1 -w /tmp/tcpdump.pcap`

Capture traffic for about a minute, then transfer the pcap to either your machine or the AttackBox to open it in Wireshark.

Example to transfer the packet capture using **scp** and open it in Wireshark:

`scp admin@10.10.37.150:/tmp/tcpdump.pcap .`
`wireshark tcpdump.pcap`

Now, you should be able to answer questions **#3** and **#4**.

Note: If you receive an error "tcpdump: /tmp/tcpdump.pcap: Permission denied" and cannot overwrite the existing **/tmp/tcpdump.pcap** file, specify a new filename such as tcpdump**2**.pcap, or run `rm -f /tmp/*.pcap` then re-run **tcpdump**.

## Sniffing while MAC Flooding

Unfortunately, we weren't able to capture any interesting traffic so far. However, we're not going to give up this easily! So, how can we capture more network traffic? As mentioned in the room description, we could try to launch a [MAC flooding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MAC_flooding) attack against the L2-Switch.

**Beware:** MAC flooding could trigger an alarm in a SOC. No, seriously, suspicious layer 2 traffic can easily be detected and reported by state-of-the-art and properly configured network devices. Even worse, your network port could even get blocked by the network device altogether, rendering your machine locked out of the network. In case of production services running on or production traffic being routed through that network connection, this could even result in an effective **Denial-of-Service**!

However, if we're successful, the switch will resort to fail-open mode and temporarily operate similarly to a network hub – forwarding all received frames to every connected port (aside from the port the traffic originated from). This would allow an adversary or pentester to sniff the network traffic between other hosts that normally wouldn't be received by their device if the switch were functioning properly.  

Considering such an attack vector is only recommended when you have reasons to believe that…

- It is in fact a switched network (and not a virtual bridge) **AND**  
- The switch might be a consumer or prosumer (unmanaged) switch **OR** the network admins haven't configured mitigations such as Dynamic ARP Inspection (DAI) for instance **AND**
- ARP and MAC spoofing attacks are explicitly permitted in the **rules of engagement**. When in doubt, clarify with your client first!  

_Anyhow, let's assume you've met the well-thought decision to give it a try._

For better usability, open a second SSH session. This way, you can leave the **tcpdump** process running in the foreground on the first SSH session:

`tcpdump -A -i eth1 -w /tmp/tcpdump2.pcap`

Now, on the second SSH session, buckle up and let **[macof](http://manpages.ubuntu.com/manpages/bionic/man8/macof.8.html)** run against the interface to start flooding the switch:  

`macof -i eth1`

After around 30 seconds, stop both **macof** and **tcpdump** (Ctrl+C).

As in the previous task, transfer the **pcap** to your machine (**kali/AttackBox)** and take a look:

`scp admin@10.10.37.150:/tmp/tcpdump2.pcap .   wireshark tcpdump2.pcap   `

Now, you should be able to answer questions **#1** and **#2**.

**Note:** If it didn't work, try to capture for 30 seconds, again (while **macof** is running).  
If it still won't work, give it one last try with a capture duration of one minute.  
As the measure of last resort, try using **[ettercap](https://www.kali.org/tools/ettercap/)** (introduced in the following tasks) with the **rand_flood** plugin:

`ettercap -T -i eth1 -P rand_flood -q -w /tmp/tcpdump3.pcap` (Quit with **q**)
<div align="center">
<br>
<br>
</div>

### Questions

##### What kind of packets is Alice continuously sending to Bob?

Start by turning on the tcpdump listening mode, and don’t forget to also write the output to a new .pcap file called “tcpdump2.pcap” and save it to the /tmp/ directory.

```shell
admin@eve:~$ sudo tcpdump -A -i eth1 -w /tmp/tcpdump2.pcap
[sudo] password for admin:
tcpdump: listening on eth1, link-type EN10MB (Ethernet), capture size 262144 bytes
^C212604 packets captured
212604 packets received by filter
0 packets dropped by kernel
```

Then open up a second SSH session, and type in the following command to start the MAC flooding attack.

```shell
admin@eve:~$ sudo macof -i eth1

...
^C
```

After around 30 seconds, stop both macof and tcpdump (Ctrl+C). As in the previous task, transfer the pcap file from the remote server to your local machine.

```shell
root@ip-10-10-245-92:~# scp admin@10.10.139.235:/tmp/tcpdump2.pcap .
admin@10.10.139.235's password:
tcpdump2.pcap                            100%   14MB 122.0MB/s   00:00
```

```shell
┌──(mopsy㉿APHP)-[~/THM]
└─$ scp root@54.216.59.129:/root/tcpdump2.pcap .
root@54.216.59.129's password:
tcpdump2.pcap                            100%   14MB   2.4MB/s   00:05
```

The next step is to open up the .pcap file with Wireshark.

```shell
┌──(mopsy㉿APHP)-[~/THM]
└─$ wireshark tcpdump2.pcap
```

This question is asking for the kind of packets Alice is continuously sending to Bob. You can’t find either Alice or Bob in the .pcap file so it is important to go back to the diagram in task 4 to find their IP addresses first. Alice’s IP is 192.168.12.1 and Bob’s IP is 192.168.12.2.

With this information in mind, you can do a quick filter to look for packets with source IP address being Alice’s IP which is 192.168.12.1. Answer is under the “protocol” column.

## 6. Man-in-the-Middle: Intro to ARP Spoofing

As you may have noticed, MAC Flooding can be considered a real "noisy" technique. In order to reduce the risk of detection and DoS we will leave **macof** aside for now. Instead, we are going to perform so-called **ARP cache poisoning** attacks against Alice and Bob, in an attempt to become a fully-fledged [Man-in-the-Middle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Man-in-the-middle_attack) (MITM).

For a deeper understanding of this technique, read the Wikipedia article on [ARP spoofing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ARP_spoofing).

_**tl;dr –** "an attacker sends (spoofed) ARP messages […] to associate the attacker's MAC address with the IP address of another host […] causing any traffic meant for that IP address to be sent to the attacker instead. ARP spoofing may allow an attacker to **intercept** data frames on a network, **modify** the traffic, or stop all traffic. Often the attack is used as an opening for other attacks, such as denial of service, **man in the middle**, or session hijacking attacks."_ _-_ [_Wikipedia - ARP spoofing_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ARP_spoofing)

![](https://tryhackme-images.s3.amazonaws.com/user-uploads/5e9955140ab79a04b28162eb/room-content/53adfdaeec3bdfa65af7b1342cc77c2c.png)  

_[https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:ARP_Spfing.svg](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:ARP_Spoofing.svg)_  

There are, however, measures and controls available to detect and prevent such attacks. In the current scenario, both hosts are running an ARP implementation that takes pains to validate incoming ARP replies. Without further ado, we are using **ettercap** to launch an ARP Spoofing attack against Alice and Bob and see how they react:

`ettercap -T -i eth1 -M arp`
<div align="center">
<br>
<br>
</div>

### Questions

##### Can ettercap establish a MITM in between Alice and Bob? (Yay/Nay)
Nay

The **“ettercap”** command is another great tool that you might want to keep in your arsenal. It is primarily used for network analysis and penetration testing. In the following command, by specifying **“-M arp”** you are carrying out an ARP poisoning attacks on the target network (which is eth1 in this case).

However, as the room instructions alluded to, the hosts (Alice and Bob) have their **ARP implementation** running. In another words, they are implementing **security measures to verify the authenticity** and correctness of ARP replies they receive. Therefore, it will be very challenging for attackers to successfully carry out ARP spoofing attacks in this scenario. As you can see from the below output, no legitimate connections among the these hosts have been established or no packets have been sent back and forth (note that the **packet size is always “0”**)

```shell
admin@eve:~$ sudo ettercap -T -i eth1 -M arp

## 7. Man-in-the-Middle: Sniffing

In this somewhat altered scenario, Alice and Bob are running a different OS (Ubuntu) with its default ARP implementation and no protective controls on their machines. As in the previous task, try to establish a MITM using **ettercap** and see if Ubuntu (by default) is falling prey to it.

After starting the VM attached to this task, you can log on via SSH with the same credentials as before:

Username: **admin**  
Password: **Layer2**

_As with the previous machine, please, also allow a minimum of **5 minutes** for this box to spin up, **then** try connecting with SSH (if you login, and the command line isn't showing up yet, **don't hit Ctrl+C!** Just be patient…)_

### Questions

##### Scan the network on eth1. Who's there? Enter their IP addresses in ascending order.
192.168.12.10, 192.168.12.20

First of all, I need to know the IP subnet range for eth1. After entering the following command, I can see the IP subnet for eth1 is “192.168.12.66/24”.

```shell
admin@eve:~$ ip a
1: lo: <LOOPBACK,UP,LOWER_UP> mtu 65536 qdisc noqueue state UNKNOWN group default qlen 1000
    link/loopback 00:00:00:00:00:00 brd 00:00:00:00:00:00
    inet 127.0.0.1/8 scope host lo

    inet6 ::1/128 scope host 
       valid_lft forever preferred_lft forever
2: ens5: <BROADCAST,MULTICAST,UP,LOWER_UP> mtu 9001 qdisc mq state UP group default qlen 1000
    link/ether 02:cd:f2:a9:74:75 brd ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff
    inet 10.10.192.5/16 brd 10.10.255.255 scope global dynamic ens5
       valid_lft 3521sec preferred_lft 3521sec
    inet6 fe80::cd:f2ff:fea9:7475/64 scope link 
       valid_lft forever preferred_lft forever
3: virbr0: <NO-CARRIER,BROADCAST,MULTICAST,UP> mtu 1500 qdisc noqueue state DOWN group default qlen 1000
    link/ether 52:54:00:8a:e8:c5 brd ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff
    inet 192.168.122.1/24 brd 192.168.122.255 scope global virbr0
       valid_lft forever preferred_lft forever
4: virbr0-nic: <BROADCAST,MULTICAST> mtu 1500 qdisc fq_codel master virbr0 state DOWN group default qlen 1000
    link/ether 52:54:00:8a:e8:c5 brd ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff
5: eth1: <BROADCAST,MULTICAST,UP,LOWER_UP> mtu 1500 qdisc noqueue state UP group default qlen 1000
    link/ether d2:51:5e:a8:de:ff brd ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff
    inet 192.168.12.66/24 brd 192.168.12.255 scope global eth1
       valid_lft forever preferred_lft forever
    inet6 fe80::f054:e7ff:fe2c:3a69/64 scope link 
       valid_lft forever preferred_lft forever
6: gns3tap0-1: <BROADCAST,MULTICAST,UP,LOWER_UP> mtu 1500 qdisc fq_codel master eth1 state UNKNOWN group default qlen 1000
    link/ether d2:51:5e:a8:de:ff brd ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff
    inet6 fe80::d051:5eff:fea8:deff/64 scope link 
       valid_lft forever preferred_lft forever
```

With this information in mind, I can use nmap to scan the live hosts in this subnet. There are 3 hosts up including Slice, Bob, and Eve (as expected).

```shell
admin@eve:~$ sudo nmap 192.168.12.66/24
[sudo] password for admin:
