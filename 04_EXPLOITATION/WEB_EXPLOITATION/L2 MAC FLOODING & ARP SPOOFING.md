### MAC Flooding

DEF-MAC Flooding is an attack where an attacker floods a network switch with a large number of fake MAC addresses.

**Why it works:**  
A switch uses a **MAC address table (CAM table)** to remember which MAC addresses are reachable on which physical ports. When the table is full, the switch can‚Äôt keep track anymore.

**Result:**  
The switch acts like a hub ‚Äî it sends all traffic to all ports. This allows the attacker to **sniff network traffic** that wasn‚Äôt meant for them.


### ARP Spoofing

ARP stands for **Address Resolution Protocol**. It maps IP addresses to MAC addresses inside a local network.

DEF-ARP Spoofing (or ARP Poisoning) is a network attack where an attacker sends **forged ARP (Address Resolution Protocol) messages** onto a local area network (LAN) to **associate their MAC address with the IP address of another device**, like the default gateway or another host.

**How the attack works:**  
An attacker sends fake ARP messages on the network. For example, they can say: _‚ÄúHey everyone, the gateway‚Äôs IP address is actually my MAC address!‚Äù_  
Devices believe it ‚Äî so they send their traffic to the attacker instead of the real router.

**Result:**  
The attacker performs a **Man-in-the-Middle (MITM)** attack. They can:
- Read network traffic
- Modify it
- Steal credentials, cookies, etc.

### üîó **How they work together**

In practice:

- **MAC Flooding** is used to make the switch forward all packets to all ports.
    
- **ARP Spoofing** poisons the network‚Äôs IP-MAC relationships so traffic is rerouted through the attacker‚Äôs machine.
    

Both techniques help attackers sniff or manipulate network data inside a **local network** (like a LAN).
