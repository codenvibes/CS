==DEF-Tabletop exercises are guided, interactive simulations that test your organisation's Computer Security Incident Response Team (CSIRT) under realistic attack scenarios..==

A tabletop exercise is a structured, facilitated discussion where participants walk through a hypothetical scenario (like a cyberattack, natural disaster, or other emergency) and talk through their roles, responses, and coordination steps.

**Key features:**
- **No physical deployment:** Unlike full-scale drills, there’s no actual field activity — it’s all done around a table (hence the name).
- **Scenario-based:** The facilitator presents a realistic situation and injects new developments to test responses.
- **Participants:** Typically includes relevant stakeholders — leadership, managers, emergency responders, IT staff, or whoever is part of the response plan.
- **Goal:** Identify gaps, clarify roles, strengthen coordination, and practice decision-making under simulated conditions.
- **After-action review:** Lessons learned are documented to update plans and training.

**Examples:**
- A hospital runs a tabletop for a mass casualty incident.
- A business practices its response to a ransomware attack.
- A city government tests its hurricane evacuation plan.

**Why they matter:**  
They’re a cost-effective way to prepare for crises, build confidence, and make sure everyone knows what to do — without risking safety or disrupting operations.

If you’d like, I can share an example scenario or even help you design a simple tabletop outline — just say the word!
