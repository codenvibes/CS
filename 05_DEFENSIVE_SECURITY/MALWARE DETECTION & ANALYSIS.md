## 1. What is the Purpose of Malware Analysis?

==**DEF-Malware analysis** is the process of examining malicious software to understand its behavior, purpose, and how it can be detected or removed.==

When analysing malware, it is important to consider the following:

- Point of Entry (PoE) i.e. Was it through spam that our e-mail filtering missed and the user opened the attachment? Let's review our spam filters and train our users better for future prevention!

- What are the indicators that malware has even been executed on a machine? Are there any files, processes, or perhaps any attempt of "un-ordinary" communication?

- How does the malware perform? Does it attempt to infect other devices? Does it encrypt files or install anything like a backdoor / Remote Access Tool (RAT)?

- Most importantly - can we ultimately prevent and/or detect further infection?!

## 2. Understanding Malware Campaigns

Despite the many variants of malware, attacks can generally be classified into two types: **Targeted** and **Mass Campaign**.  

### Targeted

A "Targeted" attack is just that - targeted. In most cases, malware attacks that occur this way are created for a specific purpose against a specific target. A great example of this type of purpose could be the [DarkHotel](https://www.kaspersky.co.uk/resource-center/threats/darkhotel-malware-virus-threat-definition) malware, whom is designed to steal information such as authentication details from government officials.

### Mass Campaign

On the other hand, the "Mass Campaign" classification can be akin to many real life examples, and is the most common type of attacks. The entire purpose of this type of Malware is to infect as many devices as possible and perform whatever it may - regardless of target.

Companies such as Kaspersky to name one, track these campaigns (known as Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs) and often report on their infection rate and indicators, much akin to the real-life spread of a virus from the World Health Organisation (WHO). 

> **APTs vs Regular Malware**
> 
> **Think of it this way:**  
> - Regular malware is like a **smash-and-grab robbery** — fast, loud, and meant to cause immediate damage.
> - **APTs** are like a **spy living in your house**, quietly gathering secrets over time while avoiding detection.

Kaspersky [report on the "Crouching Yeti (Energetic Bear)" campaign](https://www.kaspersky.co.uk/resource-center/threats/crouching-yeti-energetic-bear-malware-threat), this campaign specifically targets the following:

- Industrial/machinery
- Manufacturing
- Pharmaceutical
- Construction
- Education
- Information technology

(Kaspersky)

## 3. Identifying if a Malware Attack has Happened

Malware typically leaves behind noticeable traces on a system, making it easier for analysts to investigate, even if the activity seems minimal at first.

The ultimate process of a malware attack can be broken down into a few broad steps:
1. Delivery
2. Execution
3. Maintaining persistence (not always the case!)
4. Propagation (not always!)

**These steps will generate lots of data.** Namely: network traffic such as communicating with hosts, file system interaction like read/writes and modification.

Malware is essentially classified based upon the behaviours it produces to perform the steps listed above. For a famous example, Wannacry performs all four of these steps.

### 1. Delivery

This could be of many methods, to name a few: USB (Stuxnet!), PDF attachments through "Phishing" campaigns or vulnerability enumeration.

### 2. Execution

Here's the main part of how we classify Malware. What does it actually do? If it encrypts files - it's Ransomware! If it records information like keystrokes or displays adware - we can classify it as Spyware.

**We only understand this stage through analysing the sample, which is why analysis is important.**

### 3. Maintaining Persistence

It wouldn't make much sense for Malware authors to go through all the trouble of developing a piece of code that is capable of execution - just for it to execute and that's it...Gone. Unless you have a very specific agenda ([Cerber](https://blog.malwarebytes.com/detections/ransom-cerber/)).

I have submitted an extensive report on this specific Malware, amongst others for a University Module on Malware Analysis...however I will wait for it to be marked before sharing. 

Imagine a keylogger has been installed, but you then restart your Computer 30 seconds later. Unless you've entered a lot of sensitive information in 30 seconds - that'll be of no use to the author.

### 4. Persistence

This stage is largely why Malware is so **"noisy"**, Malware employs many techniques, of which we'll be covering in-depth much later on. Essentially, this stage is just to make sure that the "execution" is worth its while.

### 5. Propagation

Hey...If you can infect one device, why not infect more whilst you're at it? Again, this is another reason why Malware can be so noticeable. Host discovery generates a lot of network traffic, we'll come to this later.

> A **signature** is like a digital fingerprint — it's a clue or evidence that shows malware was (or still is) present on a computer system.

**In Summary, there are two categories of fingerprints that malware may leave behind on a Host after an attack:**

### Host-Based Signatures

> Clues left **on the infected computer itself** (the "host").

Think of these as **physical traces** the malware leaves on the computer:
- 🔐 **Was a file encrypted?** (like in a ransomware attack)
- 🛠️ **Did it install new programs or tools?**
- 📝 **Did it create new files, registry keys, or change system settings?**
- 📂 **Did it try to stay permanently on the system (persistence)?**

### Network-Based Signatures

> Clues seen from **network traffic** (i.e., what the malware is doing online).

Think of this as **catching malware by watching what it says or does over the internet or local network**:
- 🌍 **Is the malware trying to contact a remote server?** (e.g., to get commands or send stolen data)
- 💰 **Did it try to ask for Bitcoin payments?** (like ransomware often does)
- 📡 **Is it using suspicious protocols** (like "Samba" in the Wannacry attack)?
- 🔄 **Is it spreading to other machines on the network?**

## 4. Static Vs. Dynamic Analysis

There are two categories used when analysing malware, these are:
1. Static Analysis
2. Dynamic Analysis

### Static Analysis

Static analysis is the process of examining malware **without executing it**. This involves analyzing the code, file structure, metadata, and strings to understand what the malware is designed to do.

**Examples of Techniques:**
- Viewing strings with tools like `strings`
- Checking file hashes (MD5, SHA1, SHA256)
- Inspecting PE headers (in Windows executables)
- Using disassemblers (like IDA Pro or Ghidra)
- Analyzing imports and sections

|                     | **Pros**                                                                                                        | **Cons**                                                                                                             |
| ------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Static Analysis** | - Safe (since the malware isn't run)<br>- Helps detect obfuscation or packing<br>- Quick for simple malware<br> | - May miss behavior triggered only during execution<br>- Heavily obfuscated or packed malware can hide functionality |
### Dynamic Analysis

Dynamic analysis involves **executing the malware in a controlled environment** (like a sandbox or VM) and observing its behavior to see what it does in real-time.

**Examples of Observables:**
- File system changes (creating, modifying, deleting files)
- Network activity (connecting to C2 servers, downloading payloads)
- Registry changes
- Process creation
- Persistence mechanisms

|                      | **Pros**                                                                                       | **Cons**                                                                                                                                           |
| -------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Dynamic analysis** | - Reveals real behavior of malware<br>- Can uncover hidden or time-based functionality<br><br> | - Risky if not done in an isolated environment<br>- Sophisticated malware may detect sandboxes and alter behavior<br>- Slower than static analysis |


**Please note that these are extremely simplistic explanations of these techniques**, there is a lot more involved which we will go throughout this series.

## 6. Connecting to the Windows Analysis Environment (Deploy)

﻿﻿**Whilst malware has been known to traverse (spread) over RDP, in this instance, any and all samples on here are not capable of doing so - nor are they capable of performing any destructive action.**

This series will teach you the practical knowledge and tool familiarity to allow you to transfer these skills to **actual** samples if you wish too, **outside of TryHackMe**

With this being a Windows instance specifically, alongside the additional tools and tasks it has to execute, please expect up to wait up towards 10 minutes before being able to access your instance. The average deploy to login took about 7 minutes. Also, please note that the Host will not respond to pings - only the (Remote Desktop Protocol) RDP protocol (3389)

Credentials:

﻿**You can either connect via RDP (connect to our network first via OpenVPN), or control the machine in browser (no** connection required). Please note that this Windows "Instance" will take atleast 5 minutes to fully boot - please be patient**. You can view the progress via the progress-bar within the display above.**

`MACHINE_IP`

Username: **Analysis**

Password: **Tryhackme123!**

Windows:

- Default Remote Desktop Terminal, replace the IP Address with your `MACHINE_IP`

 ![](https://i.imgur.com/idpwmu5.png)

Linux: Any compatible RDP client such as Remmina: `sudo apt-get install remmina`

Again, replacing the IP address with your `MACHINE_IP`

## 7. Obtaining MD5 Checksums of Provided Files

MD5 "Checksums" are a prominent attribute in the malware Community. Because there can be many variants of a family of Ransomware, these MD5 "Checksums" are cryptographic "fingerprints" of the files. This allows a uniformed identification throughout the community - especially with automated Sandboxes. 

For example, say you have 20 files of unknown origin, you are able to identify their genus using their MD5 sum against websites such as [Virustotal](https://www.virustotal.com/gui/), if that MD5 "Checksum" has been previously analyzed - removing all the legwork for us!

Navigate to the **"Tasks" Folder on the Desktop**, and then enter the **"Task 7" Directory**, where there will be **three** files:
**- aws.exe**
**- NetLog.exe**
**- vlc.exe**

Sure, these are common names of executables, but anyone can name an executable as whatever they like! Just because it says "vlc" doesn't mean it is indeed the VLC application! This is where identifying their MD5 Checksum is useful, as no matter the name - their MD5 reveals its true identity.  

I have installed the ["HashTab"](http://implbits.com/products/hashtab/) application, which calculates a files MD5 sum - amongst others, directly within Windows Explorer as if you were inspecting its properties...

  ![[Pasted image 20250729182634.png]]


Your Task:

Identify the MD5 Checksums of the three files provided in "**Task 7**" (You can use Ctrl + C & Ctrl + V over RDP)
