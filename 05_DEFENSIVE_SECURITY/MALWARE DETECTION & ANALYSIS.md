## 1. What is the Purpose of Malware Analysis?

==**DEF-Malware analysis** is the process of examining malicious software to understand its behavior, purpose, and how it can be detected or removed.==

When analysing malware, it is important to consider the following:

- Point of Entry (PoE) i.e. Was it through spam that our e-mail filtering missed and the user opened the attachment? Let's review our spam filters and train our users better for future prevention!

- What are the indicators that malware has even been executed on a machine? Are there any files, processes, or perhaps any attempt of "un-ordinary" communication?

- How does the malware perform? Does it attempt to infect other devices? Does it encrypt files or install anything like a backdoor / Remote Access Tool (RAT)?

- Most importantly - can we ultimately prevent and/or detect further infection?!

## 2. Understanding Malware Campaigns

Despite the many variants of malware, attacks can generally be classified into two types: **Targeted** and **Mass Campaign**.  

### Targeted

A "Targeted" attack is just that - targeted. In most cases, malware attacks that occur this way are created for a specific purpose against a specific target. A great example of this type of purpose could be the [DarkHotel](https://www.kaspersky.co.uk/resource-center/threats/darkhotel-malware-virus-threat-definition) malware, whom is designed to steal information such as authentication details from government officials.

### Mass Campaign

On the other hand, the "Mass Campaign" classification can be akin to many real life examples, and is the most common type of attacks. The entire purpose of this type of Malware is to infect as many devices as possible and perform whatever it may - regardless of target.

Companies such as Kaspersky to name one, track these campaigns (known as Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs) and often report on their infection rate and indicators, much akin to the real-life spread of a virus from the World Health Organisation (WHO). 

> **APTs vs Regular Malware**
> 
> **Think of it this way:**  
> - Regular malware is like a **smash-and-grab robbery** — fast, loud, and meant to cause immediate damage.
> - **APTs** are like a **spy living in your house**, quietly gathering secrets over time while avoiding detection.

Kaspersky [report on the "Crouching Yeti (Energetic Bear)" campaign](https://www.kaspersky.co.uk/resource-center/threats/crouching-yeti-energetic-bear-malware-threat), this campaign specifically targets the following:

- Industrial/machinery
- Manufacturing
- Pharmaceutical
- Construction
- Education
- Information technology
