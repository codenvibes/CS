## 1. What is the Purpose of Malware Analysis?

==**DEF-Malware analysis** is the process of examining malicious software to understand its behavior, purpose, and how it can be detected or removed.==

When analysing malware, it is important to consider the following:

- Point of Entry (PoE) i.e. Was it through spam that our e-mail filtering missed and the user opened the attachment? Let's review our spam filters and train our users better for future prevention!

- What are the indicators that malware has even been executed on a machine? Are there any files, processes, or perhaps any attempt of "un-ordinary" communication?

- How does the malware perform? Does it attempt to infect other devices? Does it encrypt files or install anything like a backdoor / Remote Access Tool (RAT)?

- Most importantly - can we ultimately prevent and/or detect further infection?!

## 2. Understanding Malware Campaigns

Despite the many variants of malware, attacks can generally be classified into two types:¬†**Targeted**¬†and¬†**Mass¬†Campaign**.  

### Targeted

A "Targeted" attack is just that - targeted. In most cases, malware attacks that occur this way are created for a specific purpose against a specific target. A great example of this type of purpose could be the¬†[DarkHotel](https://www.kaspersky.co.uk/resource-center/threats/darkhotel-malware-virus-threat-definition)¬†malware, whom is designed to steal information such as authentication details from government officials.

### Mass Campaign

On the other hand, the "Mass Campaign" classification can be akin to many real life examples, and is the most common type of attacks. The entire purpose of this type of Malware is to infect as many devices as possible and perform whatever it may - regardless of target.

Companies such as Kaspersky to name one, track these campaigns (known as Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs) and often report on their infection rate and indicators, much akin to the real-life spread of a virus from the World Health Organisation (WHO).¬†

> **APTs vs Regular Malware**
> 
> **Think of it this way:**  
> - Regular malware is like a **smash-and-grab robbery** ‚Äî fast, loud, and meant to cause immediate damage.
> - **APTs** are like a **spy living in your house**, quietly gathering secrets over time while avoiding detection.

Kaspersky¬†[report on the "Crouching Yeti (Energetic Bear)" campaign](https://www.kaspersky.co.uk/resource-center/threats/crouching-yeti-energetic-bear-malware-threat), this campaign specifically targets the following:

- Industrial/machinery
- Manufacturing
- Pharmaceutical
- Construction
- Education
- Information technology

## 3. Identifying if a Malware Attack has Happened

Malware typically leaves behind noticeable traces on a system, making it easier for analysts to investigate, even if the activity seems minimal at first.

The ultimate process of a malware attack can be broken down into a few broad steps:
1. Delivery
2. Execution
3. Maintaining¬†persistence¬†(not always the case!)
4. Propagation (not always!)

**These steps will generate lots of data.**¬†Namely: network traffic such as communicating with hosts,¬†file system¬†interaction like read/writes and modification.

Malware is essentially classified based upon the behaviours it produces to perform the steps listed above.¬†For a famous example, Wannacry performs all four of these steps.

### 1.¬†Delivery

This could be of many methods, to name a few: USB (Stuxnet!), PDF attachments through "Phishing" campaigns or vulnerability enumeration.

### 2.¬†Execution

Here's the main part of how we classify Malware. What does it actually do? If it encrypts files - it's Ransomware! If it records information like¬†keystrokes¬†or displays adware - we can classify it as Spyware.

**We only understand this stage through analysing the sample, which is why analysis is important.**

### 3.¬†Maintaining¬†Persistence

It wouldn't make much sense for Malware authors to go through all the trouble of developing a piece of code that is capable of execution - just for it to execute and that's it...Gone. Unless you have a very specific agenda ([Cerber](https://blog.malwarebytes.com/detections/ransom-cerber/)).

I have submitted an extensive report on this specific Malware, amongst others for a University Module on Malware Analysis...however I will wait for it to be marked before sharing.¬†

Imagine a¬†keylogger¬†has been installed, but you then restart your Computer 30 seconds later. Unless you've entered a lot of sensitive information in 30 seconds - that'll be of no use to the author.

### 4.¬†Persistence

This stage is largely why Malware is so¬†**"noisy"**, Malware employs many techniques, of which we'll be covering in-depth much later on. Essentially, this stage is just to make sure that the "execution" is worth its while.

### 5.¬†Propagation

Hey...If you can infect one device, why not infect more whilst you're at it? Again, this is another reason why Malware can be so noticeable. Host discovery generates a lot of network traffic, we'll come to this later.

> A **signature** is like a digital fingerprint ‚Äî it's a clue or evidence that shows malware was (or still is) present on a computer system.

**In Summary, there are two categories of fingerprints that malware may leave behind on a Host after an attack:**

### Host-Based Signatures

> Clues left **on the infected computer itself** (the "host").

Think of these as **physical traces** the malware leaves on the computer:
- üîê **Was a file encrypted?** (like in a ransomware attack)
- üõ†Ô∏è **Did it install new programs or tools?**
- üìù **Did it create new files, registry keys, or change system settings?**
- üìÇ **Did it try to stay permanently on the system (persistence)?**

### Network-Based Signatures

> Clues seen from **network traffic** (i.e., what the malware is doing online).

Think of this as **catching malware by watching what it says or does over the internet or local network**:
- üåç **Is the malware trying to contact a remote server?** (e.g., to get commands or send stolen data)
- üí∞ **Did it try to ask for Bitcoin payments?** (like ransomware often does)
- üì° **Is it using suspicious protocols** (like "Samba" in the Wannacry attack)?
- üîÑ **Is it spreading to other machines on the network?**

## 4. Static Vs. Dynamic Analysis

There are two categories used when analysing malware, these are:
1.¬†Static Analysis
2.¬†Dynamic Analysis

### Static Analysis

Static analysis is the process of examining malware **without executing it**. This involves analyzing the code, file structure, metadata, and strings to understand what the malware is designed to do.

**Examples of Techniques:**
- Viewing strings with tools like `strings`
- Checking file hashes (MD5, SHA1, SHA256)
- Inspecting PE headers (in Windows executables)
- Using disassemblers (like IDA Pro or Ghidra)
- Analyzing imports and sections

|                     | **Pros**                                                                                                        | **Cons**                                                                                                             |
| ------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Static Analysis** | - Safe (since the malware isn't run)<br>- Helps detect obfuscation or packing<br>- Quick for simple malware<br> | - May miss behavior triggered only during execution<br>- Heavily obfuscated or packed malware can hide functionality |
### Dynamic Analysis

Dynamic analysis involves **executing the malware in a controlled environment** (like a sandbox or VM) and observing its behavior to see what it does in real-time.

**Examples of Observables:**
- File system changes (creating, modifying, deleting files)
- Network activity (connecting to C2 servers, downloading payloads)
- Registry changes
- Process creation
- Persistence mechanisms

|                      | **Pros**                                                                                       | **Cons**                                                                                                                                           |
| -------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Dynamic analysis** | - Reveals real behavior of malware<br>- Can uncover hidden or time-based functionality<br><br> | - Risky if not done in an isolated environment<br>- Sophisticated malware may detect sandboxes and alter behavior<br>- Slower than static analysis |


**Please note that these are extremely simplistic explanations of these techniques**, there is a lot more involved which we will go throughout this series.

## 6. Connecting to the Windows Analysis Environment (Deploy)

ÔªøÔªø**Whilst malware has been known to traverse (spread) over¬†RDP, in this instance,¬†any and all samples on here are not capable of doing so¬†- nor are they capable of performing any¬†destructive¬†action.**

This series will teach you the practical knowledge and tool familiarity to allow you to transfer these skills to¬†**actual**¬†samples if you wish too,¬†**outside of TryHackMe**

With this being a Windows instance specifically, alongside the additional tools and tasks it has to execute, please expect up to wait up towards 10 minutes before being able to access your instance. The average deploy to login took about 7 minutes. Also, please note that the Host will not respond to pings - only the (Remote Desktop Protocol)¬†RDP¬†protocol (3389)

Credentials:

Ôªø**You can either connect via¬†RDP¬†(connect to our network first via OpenVPN), or control the machine in browser (no**¬†connection required). Please note that¬†this Windows "Instance" will take atleast 5 minutes to fully boot¬†-¬†please be patient**. You can view the progress via the progress-bar within the display above.**

`MACHINE_IP`

Username:¬†**Analysis**

Password:¬†**Tryhackme123!**

Windows:

## 7. Obtaining MD5 Checksums of Provided Files

MD5¬†"Checksums" are a prominent attribute in the malware Community. Because there can be many variants of a family of Ransomware, these¬†MD5¬†"Checksums" are cryptographic "fingerprints" of the files. This allows a uniformed identification throughout the community - especially with automated Sandboxes.¬†

For example, say you have 20 files of unknown origin, you are able to identify their genus using their¬†MD5¬†sum against websites such as¬†[Virustotal](https://www.virustotal.com/gui/), if that¬†MD5¬†"Checksum" has been previously analyzed - removing all the legwork for us!

Navigate to the¬†**"Tasks" Folder on the Desktop**, and then enter the¬†**"Task 7" Directory**, where there will be¬†**three**¬†files:
**-¬†aws.exe**
**- NetLog.exe**
**- vlc.exe**

Sure, these are common names of executables, but anyone can name an executable as whatever they like! Just because it says "vlc" doesn't mean it is indeed the VLC application! This is where identifying their¬†MD5¬†Checksum is useful, as no matter the name - their¬†MD5¬†reveals its true identity.  

I have installed the #TOOLS ¬†["HashTab"](http://implbits.com/products/hashtab/)¬†application, which calculates a files¬†MD5¬†sum - amongst others, directly within Windows Explorer as if you were inspecting its properties...

  ![[Pasted image 20250729182634.png]]


Your Task:

Identify the¬†MD5¬†Checksums of the three files provided in "**Task 7**" (You can use Ctrl + C & Ctrl + V over¬†RDP)

## 9. Identifying if the Executables are obfuscated / packed

ÔªøThere are a few provided tools on this Windows instance that are capable of identifying the compiler / packer of a file. However, #TOOLS PeID has a huge database and is a great tool for this.  

Moreover, just because a file doesn't have the "**.exe**" extension, doesn't mean it isn't an actual executable! For instance, it can have the ".jpg" extension and still be an executable piece of code. This is a tad-bit out of scope for this room specifically, but essentially, files have identifying attributes within its hex - known as file headers.  

E.g. The hex value for an executable is always "**4D 5A**". So if a file with a "**.jpg**" file has the hex header of "**4D 5A**", then it is obviously not a jpg file.¬†You can read more into file headers / trailers¬†[here](https://www.garykessler.net/library/file_sigs.html), which are great resources for data carving in file forensics / recovery.  

**Provided Tools: PeID**

Now using "**PeID**", identify the compiler / packer of the following two files in the **Directory "Tasks/Task 9"** to answer the questions.  

![](https://i.imgur.com/tkj30Rv.png)  

An example of using PEiD to identify the packer of a file. In this case, it is reported as "Microsoft Visual C++ 6.0"

## 10. What is Obfuscation / Packing?

==DEF-Packing is a technique used to **hide the true contents** of a program. It's one type of **obfuscation**, which means **making something difficult to understand or analyze**.==
There are both legitimate and malicious reasons as to why the Author of a program will want to prevent the decompiling of their program.¬†

For example, a legitimate reason is the protection of intellectual property! Whilst I'm one for open-source as much as the next person here - alas not every organisation has the same mindset...but let's leave that aside.

In the same token, just because you write a program...Why should everyone have the right to "copy" your project? This is one of the justifiable reasons for obfuscation¬†- it is yours at the end of the day!¬†

However, malware Authors employ obfuscation techniques such as packing - whilst for the same reasons, they do so with the intent to prevent people like us reversing it to understand its behaviours and ultimately with the aims of achieving infection.

How packing works is out of scope for this room, but I hope to be able to delve into topics like these later on within¬†THM, so that you can understand the theory behind the practical skills you'll be using.¬†

Practical:

Your task is to identify whether or not the file¬†**"6F431F46547DB2628"**¬†located in the¬†**Directory**¬†of¬†**"Tasks\Task 10"**¬†is packed using the¬†**tool**¬†**"PeID"**¬†akin to the task you just completed!

## 11. Visualizing the Differences Between Packed & Non-Packed Code

This is another example of why #TOOLS PeID is a fantastic little tool. With its huge dataset of known¬†packers, it is arguably one of the better ones at being able to fingerprint the names of¬†packers¬†/ obfuscators within an application.  

Whilst this tool has a huge database, it doesn't have every packer out there! Especially say if an Author has written their own - #TOOLS PeID will have no way of identifying the packer used. In cases like this,¬†**it's more about what PeID doesn't tell us**¬†- rather than¬†**what it does.**

Practical:

You can try this yourself by navigating to¬†**directory**¬†**"Tasks/Task 11"**¬†and dragging and dropping that file into PeID. What does it tell us?

![](https://i.imgur.com/JVOrgcz.png)  

In this instance, PeID is able to detect what packer has been used to obfuscate the code.¬†¬†Whilst PeID is capable of detecting the possibility of¬†packers¬†being used, it is not able to automatically de-obfuscate them. This is a process we will have to do manually - at a later stage.

After confirming that this file is indeed packed, let's open it up with a tool called¬†#TOOLS **IDA Freeware**. This is located in¬†the¬†**"Tools/Static/Disassembly" directory**¬†(or you can search for it through Windows Toolbar).¬†Notice how there is a very minimal amount of information provided to us? For example, the "Imports" tab is practically empty! Little odd...right?

When opening the file, a few dialogue boxes may appear - its just IDA Freeware processing the file, it'll take a couple of seconds.

![](https://i.imgur.com/GJZPTRK.png)

![](https://i.imgur.com/q8MknAs.png)

![](https://i.imgur.com/UB7tqdk.png)  

We can see there are only two "**Imports"**¬†in this program! That's a bit bizarre...

...The use of "IDA Free" will be developed upon as it is an advanced bit of kit. But essentially, we can see the flow of how the program executes - indicated by the arrows. The problem? There's very little here! There are a few more characteristics that indicate its packed, but this is also beyond the scope for this room.¬†

![](https://i.imgur.com/YtCCrw1.png)  

Whereas, if we were to open a file that isn't obfuscated, we should expect to see a much larger import count and graph/flowchart, like this:

![](https://i.imgur.com/yOyFwrJ.png)  

![](https://i.imgur.com/XM6eSBr.png)  

See how there's so much more information here? Obfuscated code is much harder to analyze at least at the static level, as we're presented with very little information!

## 12. Introduction to Strings

"**Strings**" are essentially the ASCII / Text contents of a program...this could be anything from passwords for self-extracting zips, to bitcoin addresses in ransomware samples.

Such as that in the example above, when analysing the contents of these strings, we can sometimes paint a fairly indicative picture of the behaviours of the programme - bitcoin wallets being used in ransomware.  

Task:¬†

Open a Command prompt on the Windows Machine and navigate to the directory¬†**"Tools\Sysinternalssuite"**

`cd C:\Users\Analysis\Desktop\Tools\SysinternalsSuite`

**Keep this terminal open.**

We're going to use Microsoft's Sysinternals "Strings" program to output the retained strings within the specified file in "Task 12". We can do this by:

`strings "C:\Users\Analysis\Desktop\Tasks\Task 12\67844C01"`  

You will receive a whole load of text, most of it looks like nonsense...But there is some text in there that is valuable. Scroll up!

![[Pasted image 20250729195021.png]]

**Proceed to answering Question 1.**

You'll find that programs often contain large amount of strings and using the "strings" tool from sysinternals may only display 10% of these...

...That and it's not exactly practical scrolling up through a terminal for stuff like this - we are on Windows afterall! There's a¬†GUI¬†tool for that.

Launch the application within¬†**"Tools/Static/PE¬†Tools/PE¬†Explorer"**¬†and¬†**drag and drop**¬†the same file¬†**"67844C01"**¬†from the previous question into the application.  

![](https://i.imgur.com/XDmSuSX.png)¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†

Where you will be presented with the following, indicating that it has successfully imported:  

![](https://i.imgur.com/822wO58.png)¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† ¬†¬†  

After import. Navigate to¬†"View -> Imports"

## 13. Introduction to Imports

The classification of IDA Freeware is arguable as the tool can be used for both static and¬†dynamic analysis. Without going too in-depth regarding the differences, there are two classifications of tools like IDA Freeware:

- Disassemblers
- Debuggers

I'll allow you to explore the differences between these two types of tools and their use cases in your own time, but for contextual sake - Disassemblers¬†reverse the compiled code of a program from machine code to human-readable instructions (assembly). This is limited to how the program represents itself in its current state! I.e. If the contents of an executable changes during execution - "Disassemblers" will not reflect this.

Whilst Debuggers deploy the same techniques used by "Disassemblers", "Debuggers" essentially facilitate execution of the program - where the analyser can view the changes made throughout each "step" of the program. These tools are great because a true picture of the program presents itself. However, if it is indeed malicious, you have now infected yourself.

With enough understanding, an analyser can introduce "breakpoints" (or pauses) at various stages of a program, where the program will execute up until a breakpoint. For example, sticking with the idea of Ransomware, an analyser can create a "breakpoint" within the application prior to the actual stage of encryption of files. This facilitates¬†an analyser to view the various changes of a program during execution (such as unpacking or connecting to a remote server such as that in a botnet) up until the point of malicious infection.

  

Practical:

For this room, we will be using #TOOLS IDA Freeware within the context of statistical analysis. I'll walkthrough how to import an executable into IDA Freeware below.  

1. Lets launch "IDA Freeware" and select the file to import, in this case we'll be using "uninstall.exe"

	And navigate to the file...

¬†2.¬†Since we know it is an executable file, we select "Portable executable for 80386 (PE) [pe64.dll]"
	
	![](https://i.imgur.com/I9TUxXi.png)
	
¬†2. After pressing "OK" the application will load. Allow a few minutes for the executable to be decompiled.

	There are various tabs, similar to what we saw in "PE¬†Explorer" i.e. "Imports" and "Exports".

Task:  

Navigate to the directory "**Tasks/Task 13**" and open¬†"**install.exe**" with IDA Freeware, just like we did in the example above.¬†Again, this may take a few seconds to a couple of minutes to compute dependant upon the size of the application. For this task expect roughly ~20 seconds.

You can now answer the question below:
