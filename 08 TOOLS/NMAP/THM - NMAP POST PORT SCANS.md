## 1. Introduction

This room is the last in the Nmap series (part of the Introduction to Network Security module). In this room, we focus on the steps that follow port-scanning: in particular, service detection, OS detection, Nmap scripting engine, and saving the scan results.

1. [Nmap Live Host Discovery](https://tryhackme.com/room/nmap01)
2. [Nmap Basic Port Scans](https://tryhackme.com/room/nmap02)
3. [Nmap Advanced Port Scans](https://tryhackme.com/room/nmap03)
4. [Nmap Post Port Scans](https://tryhackme.com/room/nmap04)

In the first room of this series, we have learned how Nmap can enumerate targets, discover live hosts, and use reverse-DNS to find interesting names. The second and third rooms of the series focused on the basic and advanced types of scans for network ports.

In the last room, as shown in the figure below, we focus on how Nmap can be used to:

- Detect versions of the running services (on all open ports)
- Detect the OS based on any signs revealed by the target
- Run Nmap’s traceroute
- Run select Nmap scripts
- Save the scan results in various formats

This room will focus on these steps and how to execute them after the port scan.

### Questions

##### Ensure you have a solid understanding of how the Nmap scan progresses and the steps and stages it follows. Launch the AttackBox by using the Start AttackBox button, as you will need it to answer the questions in later tasks.

## 2. Service Detection

Once Nmap discovers open ports, you can probe the available port to detect the running service. Further investigation of open ports is an essential piece of information as the pentester can use it to learn if there are any known vulnerabilities of the service. Join [Vulnerabilities 101](https://tryhackme.com/room/vulnerabilities101) to learn more about searching for vulnerable services.

Adding `-sV` to your Nmap command will collect and determine service and version information for the open ports. You can control the intensity with `--version-intensity LEVEL` where the level ranges between 0, the lightest, and 9, the most complete. `-sV --version-light` has an intensity of 2, while `-sV --version-all` has an intensity of 9.

It is important to note that using `-sV` will force Nmap to proceed with the TCP 3-way handshake and establish the connection. The connection establishment is necessary because Nmap cannot discover the version without establishing a connection fully and communicating with the listening service. In other words, stealth SYN scan `-sS` is not possible when `-sV` option is chosen.

The console output below shows a simple Nmap stealth SYN scan with the `-sV` option. Adding the `-sV` option leads to a new column in the output showing the version for each detected service. For instance, in the case of TCP port 22 being open, instead of `22/tcp open ssh`, we obtain `22/tcp open ssh OpenSSH 6.7p1 Debian 5+deb8u8 (protocol 2.0)`. Notice that the SSH protocol is guessed as the service because TCP port 22 is open; Nmap didn’t need to connect to port 22 to confirm. However, `-sV` required connecting to this open port to grab the service banner and any version information it can get, such as `nginx 1.6.2`. Hence, unlike the _service_ column, the _version_ column is not a guess.

Note that many Nmap options require root privileges. Unless you are running Nmap as root, you need to use `sudo` as in the example above.
