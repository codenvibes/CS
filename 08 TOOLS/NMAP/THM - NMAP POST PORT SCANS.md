## 1. Introduction

This room is the last in the Nmap series (part of the Introduction to Network Security module). In this room, we focus on the steps that follow port-scanning: in particular, service detection, OS detection, Nmap scripting engine, and saving the scan results.

1. [Nmap Live Host Discovery](https://tryhackme.com/room/nmap01)
2. [Nmap Basic Port Scans](https://tryhackme.com/room/nmap02)
3. [Nmap Advanced Port Scans](https://tryhackme.com/room/nmap03)
4. [Nmap Post Port Scans](https://tryhackme.com/room/nmap04)

In the first room of this series, we have learned how Nmap can enumerate targets, discover live hosts, and use reverse-DNS to find interesting names. The second and third rooms of the series focused on the basic and advanced types of scans for network ports.

In the last room, as shown in the figure below, we focus on how Nmap can be used to:

- Detect versions of the running services (on all open ports)
- Detect the OS based on any signs revealed by the target
- Run Nmap’s traceroute
- Run select Nmap scripts
- Save the scan results in various formats

This room will focus on these steps and how to execute them after the port scan.

### Questions

##### Ensure you have a solid understanding of how the Nmap scan progresses and the steps and stages it follows. Launch the AttackBox by using the Start AttackBox button, as you will need it to answer the questions in later tasks.
