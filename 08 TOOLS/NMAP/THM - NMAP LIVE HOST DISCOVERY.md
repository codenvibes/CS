## 1. Introduction

When we want to target a network, we want to find an efficient tool to help us handle repetitive tasks and answer the following questions:

1. Which systems are up?
2. What services are running on these systems?

The tool that we will rely on is Nmap. The first question about finding live computers is answered in this room. This room is the first in a series of four rooms dedicated to Nmap. The second question about discovering running services is answered in the next Nmap rooms that focus on port-scanning.

This room is the first of four in this Nmap series. These four rooms are also part of the Network Security module.

1. [Nmap Live Host Discovery](https://tryhackme.com/room/nmap01)
2. [Nmap Basic Port Scans](https://tryhackme.com/room/nmap02)
3. [Nmap Advanced Port Scans](https://tryhackme.com/room/nmap03)
4. [Nmap Post Port Scans](https://tryhackme.com/room/nmap04)

This room explains the steps that Nmap carries out to discover the systems that are online before port-scanning. This stage is crucial because trying to port-scan offline systems will only waste time and create unnecessary noise on the network.

We present the different approaches that Nmap uses to discover live hosts. In particular, we cover:

1. ARP scan: This scan uses ARP requests to discover live hosts
2. ICMP scan: This scan uses ICMP requests to identify live hosts
3. TCP/UDP ping scan: This scan sends packets to TCP ports and UDP ports to determine live hosts.

We also introduce two scanners, `arp-scan` and `masscan`, and explain how they overlap with part of Nmap’s host discovery.

As already mentioned, starting with this room, we will use Nmap to discover systems and services actively. Nmap was created by Gordon Lyon (Fyodor), a network security expert and open source programmer. It was released in 1997. Nmap, short for Network Mapper, is free, open-source software released under GPL license. Nmap is an industry-standard tool for mapping networks, identifying live hosts, and discovering running services. Nmap’s scripting engine can further extend its functionality, from fingerprinting services to exploiting vulnerabilities. A Nmap scan usually goes through the steps shown in the figure below, although many are optional and depend on the command-line arguments you provide.
