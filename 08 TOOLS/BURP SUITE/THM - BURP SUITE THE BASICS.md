## 2. What is Burp Suite

In essence, Burp Suite is a Java-based framework designed to serve as a comprehensive solution for conducting web application penetration testing. It has become the industry standard tool for hands-on security assessments of web and mobile applications, including those that rely on **a**pplication **p**rogramming **i**nterface**s** (APIs).

Simply put, Burp Suite captures and enables manipulation of all the HTTP/HTTPS traffic between a browser and a web server. This fundamental capability forms the backbone of the framework. By intercepting requests, users have the flexibility to route them to various components within the Burp Suite framework, which we will explore in upcoming sections. The ability to intercept, view, and modify web requests before they reach the target server or even manipulate responses before they are received by our browser makes Burp Suite an invaluable tool for manual web application testing.

Burp Suite is available in different editions. For our purposes, we will focus on the **Burp Suite Community Edition**, which is freely accessible for non-commercial use within legal boundaries. However, it's worth noting that Burp Suite also offers Professional and Enterprise editions, which come with advanced features and require licensing:

1. **Burp Suite Professional** is an unrestricted version of Burp Suite Community. It comes with features such as:
    
    - An automated vulnerability scanner.
    - A fuzzer/brute-forcer that isn't rate limited.
    - Saving projects for future use and report generation.
    - A built-in API to allow integration with other tools.
    - Unrestricted access to add new extensions for greater functionality.
    - Access to the Burp Suite Collaborator (effectively providing a unique request catcher self-hosted or running on a Portswigger-owned server).
    
    In short, Burp Suite Professional is a highly potent tool, making it a preferred choice for professionals in the field.
    
1. **Burp Suite Enterprise**, in contrast to the community and professional editions, is primarily utilized for continuous scanning. It features an automated scanner that periodically scans web applications for vulnerabilities, similar to how tools like Nessus perform automated infrastructure scanning. Unlike the other editions, which allow manual attacks from a local machine, Burp Suite Enterprise resides on a server and constantly scans the target web applications for potential vulnerabilities.
    ![Preview of Burp Suite Enterprise](https://tryhackme-images.s3.amazonaws.com/user-uploads/645b19f5d5848d004ab9c9e2/room-content/6b7cdf06b365b6908c41525e8efb86e0.png)

Due to requiring a license for the Professional and Enterprise editions, we will focus on the core feature set provided by the Burp Suite Community Edition.

**Note:** The provided demonstrations utilize Burp Suite for Windows. However, the functionality remains consistent with the version installed on the AttackBox.

## 3. Features of Burp Community

Although Burp Suite Community offers a more limited feature set compared to the Professional edition, it still provides an impressive array of tools that are highly valuable for web application testing. Let's explore some of the key features:

- **Proxy**: The Burp Proxy is the most renowned aspect of Burp Suite. It enables interception and modification of requests and responses while interacting with web applications.
- **Repeater**: Another well-known feature. [Repeater](https://tryhackme.com/room/burpsuiterepeater) allows for capturing, modifying, and resending the same request multiple times. This functionality is particularly useful when crafting payloads through trial and error (e.g., in SQLi - Structured Query Language Injection) or testing the functionality of an endpoint for vulnerabilities.
- **Intruder**: Despite rate limitations in Burp Suite Community, [Intruder](https://tryhackme.com/room/burpsuiteintruder) allows for spraying endpoints with requests. It is commonly utilized for brute-force attacks or fuzzing endpoints.
- **Decoder**: [Decoder](https://tryhackme.com/room/burpsuiteom) offers a valuable service for data transformation. It can decode captured information or encode payloads before sending them to the target. While alternative services exist for this purpose, leveraging Decoder within Burp Suite can be highly efficient.
- **Comparer**: As the name suggests, [Comparer](https://tryhackme.com/room/burpsuiteom) enables the comparison of two pieces of data at either the word or byte level. While not exclusive to Burp Suite, the ability to send potentially large data segments directly to a comparison tool with a single keyboard shortcut significantly accelerates the process.
- **Sequencer**: [Sequencer](https://tryhackme.com/room/burpsuiteom) is typically employed when assessing the randomness of tokens, such as session cookie values or other supposedly randomly generated data. If the algorithm used for generating these values lacks secure randomness, it can expose avenues for devastating attacks.

Beyond the built-in features, the Java codebase of Burp Suite facilitates the development of extensions to enhance the framework's functionality. These extensions can be written in Java, Python (using the Java Jython interpreter), or Ruby (using the Java JRuby interpreter). The **Burp Suite Extender** module allows for quick and easy loading of extensions into the framework, while the marketplace, known as the **BApp Store**, enables downloading of third-party modules. While certain extensions may require a professional license for integration, there are still a considerable number of extensions available for Burp Community. For instance, the **Logger++** module can extend the built-in logging functionality of Burp Suite.

## 6. Navigation

In Burp Suite, the default navigation is primarily done through the top menu bars, which allow you to switch between modules and access various sub-tabs within each module. The sub-tabs appear in a second menu bar directly below the main menu bar.

Here's how the navigation works:

1. **Module Selection**: The top row of the menu bar displays the available modules in Burp Suite. You can click on each module to switch between them. For example, the Burp Proxy module is selected in the image below.
    ![](https://tryhackme-images.s3.amazonaws.com/user-uploads/5d9e176315f8850e719252ed/room-content/cb50d9d010fd277b7ce2c9acf2481125.png)

2. **Sub-Tabs**: If a selected module has multiple sub-tabs, they can be accessed through the second menu bar that appears directly below the main menu bar. These sub-tabs often contain module-specific settings and options. For example, in the image above, the Proxy Intercept sub-tab is selected within the Burp Proxy module.

3. **Detaching Tabs**: If you prefer to view multiple tabs separately, you can detach them into separate windows. To do this, go to the **Window** option in the application menu above the **Module Selection** bar. From there, choose the "Detach" option, and the selected tab will open in a separate window. The detached tabs can be reattached using the same method.

## 7. Options

Before diving into the Burp Proxy, let's explore the available options for configuring Burp Suite. There are two types of settings: Global settings (also known as User settings) and Project settings.

- **Global Settings**: These settings affect the entire Burp Suite installation and are applied every time you start the application. They provide a baseline configuration for your Burp Suite environment.

- **Project Settings**: These settings are specific to the current project and apply only during the session. However, please note that Burp Suite Community Edition does not support saving projects, so any project-specific options will be lost when you close Burp.
	
	To access the settings, click on the **Settings** button in the top navigation bar. This will open a separate settings window.
    ![Settings button to open the separate settings window](https://tryhackme-images.s3.amazonaws.com/user-uploads/5d9e176315f8850e719252ed/room-content/40a3ea01d6eadc91d98499c3f921c90f.png)

## 8. Introduction to the Burp Proxy

The Burp Proxy is a fundamental and crucial tool within Burp Suite. It enables the capture of requests and responses between the user and the target web server. This intercepted traffic can be manipulated, sent to other tools for further processing, or explicitly allowed to continue to its destination.

#### Key Points to Understand About the Burp Proxy

- **Intercepting Requests:** When requests are made through the Burp Proxy, they are intercepted and held back from reaching the target server. The requests appear in the Proxy tab, allowing for further actions such as forwarding, dropping, editing, or sending them to other Burp modules. To disable the intercept and allow requests to pass through the proxy without interruption, click the `Intercept is on` button.
    
    ![](https://tryhackme-images.s3.amazonaws.com/user-uploads/5d9e176315f8850e719252ed/room-content/73989984d0985412a3405ea1d6f8d171.png)
    
- **Taking Control:** The ability to intercept requests empowers testers to gain complete control over web traffic, making it invaluable for testing web applications.

- **Capture and Logging:** Burp Suite captures and logs requests made through the proxy by default, even when the interception is turned off. This logging functionality can be helpful for later analysis and review of prior requests.

- **WebSocket Support:** Burp Suite also captures and logs WebSocket communication, providing additional assistance when analysing web applications.

- **Logs and History:** The captured requests can be viewed in the **HTTP history** and **WebSockets history** sub-tabs, allowing for retrospective analysis and sending the requests to other Burp modules as needed.
    ![](https://tryhackme-images.s3.amazonaws.com/user-uploads/5d9e176315f8850e719252ed/room-content/8d5388b41dc847d2af38acf7ef4b116c.png)
    
    Proxy-specific options can be accessed by clicking the **Proxy settings** button. These options provide extensive control over the Proxy’s behavior and functionality. Familiarize yourself with these options to optimize your Burp Proxy usage.

#### Some Notable Features in the Proxy Settings

- **Response Interception:** By default, the proxy does not intercept server responses unless explicitly requested on a per-request basis. The "Intercept responses based on the following rules" checkbox, along with the defined rules, allows for a more flexible response interception.
    ![](https://tryhackme-images.s3.amazonaws.com/user-uploads/5d9e176315f8850e719252ed/room-content/e24fd91064186b78014d6afd773d60f3.png)
    
- **Match and Replace:** The "Match and Replace" section in the **Proxy settings** enables the use of regular expressions (regex) to modify incoming and outgoing requests. This feature allows for dynamic changes, such as modifying the user agent or manipulating cookies.

Take the time to explore and experiment with the Proxy options, as this will enhance your understanding and proficiency with the tool.
