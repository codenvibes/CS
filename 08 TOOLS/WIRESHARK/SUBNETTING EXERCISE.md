## Subnetting Exercise

Complete the given subnetting exercises. First, you could start by watching the subnetting series from Practical Networking YouTube channel, [click here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BWZ-MHIhqjM&list=PLIFyRwBY_4bQUE4IB5c4VPRyDoLgOdExE).

1. A company has been allocated a Class C network 192.168.5.0/24. The physical network should be divided into 5 subnets, which will be interconnected by routers as shown in the figure below. Class C custom subnets need to be designed. Derive the subnets that would meet the requirements shown outlining the;
	- Network address (network ID)
	- First and last usable IP addresses
	- Broadcast address (broadcast ID)
	- Hosts per subnet

2. For each of the following IP addresses, carry out fixed length subnetting (FLSM) by applying the given subnet mask and utilizing additional masking bits borrowed from the default subnet mask. Determine the number of possible subnets per the given network ID but only state the first three subnets, where possible. Consider the zero subnet in each of the below network IDs as your first possible subnet.
	Additionally, in every subnet, determine the; number of hosts, network address/ID, first and last usable IP, and the broadcast address.
	
	a) 192.168.10.0/25
	b) 192.168.10.0/28
	c) 10.0.0.0/30
	d) 10.0.0.0/16
	e) 172.16.0.0/30
	f) 172.16.0.0/17
