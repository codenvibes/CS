## SECTION A: Installing Wireshark

For the assignment that follows in the next section, you will be working with the Wireshark tool. To install Wireshark, follow the following steps:

1. Visit [https://www.wireshark.org/download.html](https://www.wireshark.org/download.html) to download the installation file.
2. Download the latest stable release based on your OS e.g. Wireshark-win64-4.0.2.exe for Windows 64-bit architecture installer.
3. Locate the downloaded file, double click to launch and install. If you had an earlier version of Wireshark, you will be prompted to uninstall it before you install the newer version.
4. Follow through the prompt guidelines for installation. Note that:
    1. It is recommended to keep the default installation folder location
    2. Npcap needs to be installed for live captures. If you already have npcap but its version is older, it is recommended to install the newer version that comes with the Wireshark installation  
        
    3. Do NOT select the box to install USBPcap - it could cause problems with your USB port and is not required in this course  
        
5. Reboot your computer once the installation is complete.
