#THMLP-JR_PENETRATION_TESTER #THMMOD-METASPLOIT #Metasploit

## 1. Introduction

In this room, we will learn how to use Metasploit for vulnerability scanning and exploitation. We will also cover how the database feature makes it easier to manage penetration testing engagements with a broader scope. Finally, we will look at generating payloads with msfvenom and how to start a Meterpreter session on most target platforms.

More specifically, the topics we will cover are:

- How to scan target systems using Metasploit.
- How to use the Metasploit database feature.
- How to use Metasploit to conduct a vulnerability scan.
- How to use Metasploit to exploit vulnerable services on target systems.
- How `msfvenom` can be used to create payloads and obtain a Meterpreter session on the target system.

Please note that for all questions that require using a wordlist (e.g brute-force attacks), we will be using the wordlist on the AttackBox found at the following path:

`/usr/share/wordlists/MetasploitRoom/MetasploitWordlist.txt` 

If you opt to use your own machine, please download the wordlist by clicking the Download Task Files button to the right.

Start the AttackBox and run Metasploit using the `msfconsole` command to follow along with this room.

## 2. Scanning

### Port Scanning

Metasploit has a number of modules to scan open ports on the target system and network. You can list potential port scanning modules available using the `search portscan` command.

Search portscan

```shell-session
msf6 > search portscan

```

Port scanning modules will require you to set a few options:

Portscan options

```shell-session
msf6 auxiliary(scanner/portscan/tcp) > show options

Module options (auxiliary/scanner/portscan/tcp):

   Name         Current Setting  Required  Description
   ----         ---------------  --------  -----------
   CONCURRENCY  10               yes       The number of concurrent ports to check per host
   DELAY        0                yes       The delay between connections, per thread, in milliseconds
   JITTER       0                yes       The delay jitter factor (maximum value by which to +/- DELAY) in milliseconds.
   PORTS        1-10000          yes       Ports to scan (e.g. 22-25,80,110-900)
   RHOSTS                        yes       The target host(s), range CIDR identifier, or hosts file with syntax 'file:'
   THREADS      1                yes       The number of concurrent threads (max one per host)
   TIMEOUT      1000             yes       The socket connect timeout in milliseconds

msf6 auxiliary(scanner/portscan/tcp) >
```

- **CONCURRENCY:** Number of targets to be scanned simultaneously.
- **PORTS:** Port range to be scanned. Please note that 1-1000 here will not be the same as using Nmap with the default configuration. Nmap will scan the 1000 most used ports, while Metasploit will scan port numbers from 1 to 10000.
- **RHOSTS:** Target or target network to be scanned.
- **THREADS:** Number of threads that will be used simultaneously. More threads will result in faster scans.

You can directly perform Nmap scans from the msfconsole prompt as shown below faster:  

UsingNmapfrom the Msfconsole prompt

```shell-session
msf6 > nmap -sS 10.10.12.229

As for information gathering, if your engagement requires a speedier approach to port scanning, Metasploit may not be your first choice. However, a number of modules make Metasploit a useful tool for the scanning phase.
<div>
<br>
</div>

### UDP service Identification

The `scanner/discovery/udp_sweep` module will allow you to quickly identify services running over the UDP (User Datagram Protocol). As you can see below, this module will not conduct an extensive scan of all possible UDP services but does provide a quick way to identify services such as DNS or NetBIOS.

UDP scan

```shell-session
msf6 auxiliary(scanner/discovery/udp_sweep) > run

[*] Sending 13 probes to 10.10.12.229->10.10.12.229 (1 hosts)
[*] Discovered NetBIOS on 10.10.12.229:137 (JON-PC::U :WORKGROUP::G :JON-PC::U :WORKGROUP::G :WORKGROUP::U :__MSBROWSE__::G :02:ce:59:27:c8:e3)
[*] Scanned 1 of 1 hosts (100% complete)
[*] Auxiliary module execution completed
msf6 auxiliary(scanner/discovery/udp_sweep) >
```
<div>
<br>
</div>

### SMB Scans

Metasploit offers several useful auxiliary modules that allow us to scan specific services. Below is an example for the SMB. Especially useful in a corporate network would be `smb_enumshares` and `smb_version` but please spend some time to identify scanners that the Metasploit version installed on your system offers.

SMBscan

```shell-session
msf6 auxiliary(scanner/smb/smb_version) > run

[+] 10.10.12.229:445      - Host is running Windows 7 Professional SP1 (build:7601) (name:JON-PC) (workgroup:WORKGROUP ) (signatures:optional)
[*] 10.10.12.229:445      - Scanned 1 of 1 hosts (100% complete)
[*] Auxiliary module execution completed
msf6 auxiliary(scanner/smb/smb_version) >
```

When performing service scans, it would be important not to omit more "exotic" services such as NetBIOS. NetBIOS (Network Basic Input Output System), similar to SMB, allows computers to communicate over the network to share files or send files to printers. The NetBIOS name of the target system can give you an idea about its role and even importance (e.g. CORP-DC, DEVOPS, SALES, etc.). You may also run across some shared files and folders that could be accessed either without a password or protected with a simple password (e.g. admin, administrator, root, toor, etc.).

Remember, Metasploit has many modules that can help you have a better understanding of the target system and possibly help you find vulnerabilities. It is always worth performing a quick search to see if there are any modules that could be helpful based on your target system.

</div>

### Questions

##### How many ports are open on the target system?
##### Using the relevant scanner, what NetBIOS name can you see?
##### What is running on port 8000?
##### What is the "penny" user's SMB password? Use the wordlist mentioned in the previous task.

## 3. The Metasploit Database

While it is not required when interacting with a single target on TryHackMe, an actual penetration testing engagement will likely have several targets.

Metasploit has a database function to simplify project management and avoid possible confusion when setting up parameter values.

**Please note** the following steps have already been taken in the TryHackMe AttackBox, so you will only need to do this if you are using Kali or have installed Metasploit yourself.

You will first need to start the PostgreSQL database, which Metasploit will use with the following command: `systemctl start postgresql`.

Then you will need to initialize the Metasploit Database using the `msfdb init` command. However, trying to run `msfdb init` as root will give the following error message, "Please run msfdb as a non-root user." This can be solved by running it as the `postgres` account using `sudo -u postgres msfdb init`.

The terminal below shows the example output. As mentioned, the steps below have already been performed on the AttackBox; however, if you are interested in repeating them, you will need to delete the existing database first using `sudo -u postgres msfdb delete`.

Starting Postgresql

```shell-session
root@attackbox:~# systemctl start postgresql 
root@attackbox:~# sudo -u postgres msfdb init
Running the 'init' command for the database:
Creating database at /var/lib/postgresql/.msf4/db
Creating db socket file at /tmp
Starting database at /var/lib/postgresql/.msf4/db...waiting for server to start.... done
server started
success
Creating database users
Writing client authentication configuration file /var/lib/postgresql/.msf4/db/pg_hba.conf
Stopping database at /var/lib/postgresql/.msf4/db
Starting database at /var/lib/postgresql/.msf4/db...waiting for server to start.... done
server started
success
Creating initial database schema
Database initialization successful
root@attackbox:~#
```

You can now launch `msfconsole` and check the database status using the `db_status` command.

Checking the database status

```shell-session
msf6 > db_status
[*] Connected to msf. Connection type: postgresql.
msf6 >
```

The database feature will allow you to create workspaces to isolate different projects. When first launched, you should be in the default workspace. You can list available workspaces using the `workspace` command.

Listing workspaces

```shell-session
msf6 > workspace
* default
msf6 >
```

You can add a workspace using the `-a` parameter or delete a workspace using the `-d` parameter, respectively. The screenshot below shows that a new workspace named "tryhackme" was created.

Adding a workspace

```shell-session
msf6 > workspace -a tryhackme
[*] Added workspace: tryhackme
[*] Workspace: tryhackme
msf5 > workspace
default
* tryhackme
msf6 >
```

You will also notice that the new database name is printed in red, starting with a `*` symbol.

You can use the workspace command to navigate between workspaces simply by typing `workspace` followed by the desired workspace name.

Changing workspaces

```shell-session
msf6 > workspace
default
* tryhackme
msf5 > workspace default
[*] Workspace: default
msf5 > workspace 
tryhackme
* default
msf6 >
```

You can use the `workspace -h` command to list available options for the `workspace` command.

Workspace help menu

```shell-session
msf6 > workspace -h
Usage:
workspace                  List workspaces
workspace -v               List workspaces verbosely
workspace [name]           Switch workspace
workspace -a [name] ...    Add workspace(s)
workspace -d [name] ...    Delete workspace(s)
workspace -D               Delete all workspaces
workspace -r     Rename workspace
workspace -h               Show this help information
```

Different from regular Metasploit usage, once Metasploit is launched with a database, the `help` command, you will show the Database Backends Commands menu.

Database backend commands

```shell-session
Database Backend Commands

```

If you run a Nmap scan using the `db_nmap` shown below, all results will be saved to the database.

The db_nmap command

```shell-session
msf6 > db_nmap -sV -p- 10.10.12.229

The `hosts -h` and `services -h` commands can help you become more familiar with available options. Once the host information is stored in the database, you can use the `hosts -R` command to add this value to the RHOSTS parameter.

**Example Workflow**

1. We will use the vulnerability scanning module that finds potential MS17-010 vulnerabilities with the `use auxiliary/scanner/smb/smb_ms17_010` command.
2. We set the RHOSTS value using `hosts -R`.
3. We have typed `show options` to check if all values were assigned correctly. (In this example, 10.10.138.32 is the IP address we have scanned earlier using the `db_nmap` command)
4. Once all parameters are set, we launch the exploit using the `run` or `exploit` command.

msf6 auxiliary(scanner/smb/smb_ms17_010) > run
```

  
If there is more than one host saved to the database, all IP addresses will be used when the `hosts -R` command is used.   

In a typical penetration testing engagement, we could have the following scenario: 

- Finding available hosts using the `db_nmap` command
- Scanning these for further vulnerabilities or open ports (using a port scanning module) 

The services command used with the `-S` parameter will allow you to search for specific services in the environment.

Querying the database for services

```shell-session
msf6 > services -S netbios

You may want to look for low-hanging fruits such as:

- HTTP: Could potentially host a web application where you can find vulnerabilities like SQL injection or Remote Code Execution (RCE).
- FTP: Could allow anonymous login and provide access to interesting files.
- SMB: Could be vulnerable to SMB exploits like MS17-010
- SSH: Could have default or easy to guess credentials
- RDP: Could be vulnerable to Bluekeep or allow desktop access if weak credentials were used. 

As you can see, Metasploit has many features to aid in engagements such as the ability to compartmentalize your engagements into workspaces, analyze your results at a high level, and quickly import and explore data.
