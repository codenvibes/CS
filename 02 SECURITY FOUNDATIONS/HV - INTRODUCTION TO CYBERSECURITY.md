## Introduction

Information is typically characterized by the highest possible degree of certainty, assumed to be accurate and valid, and available to individuals or groups.

Ref: [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knowledge)

The most important feature of information is that it provides us with meaning and context about the world around us. For example, when we read a book or talk to someone, we learn new information and use this information to shape our thoughts and behaviors.

**White Hat:** White hat hackers are well-intentioned hackers who know the techniques and methods used by cyber criminals and recognize the tools and software used during hacker activities.

Ref: [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_hat_\(computer_security\))

White hat hackers work to enhance system security. They collaborate with companies to identify security vulnerabilities and help them fix these issues.

**Black Hat:** Black hat hackers are malicious hackers who harm systems, steal information, and gain unauthorized access to systems.

Ref: [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_hat_\(computer_security\))

Often depicted as the "bad guys" in the media, these hackers breach security systems for personal gain or other harmful intentions. Their actions include data theft, spreading malware, and other cybercrimes.

**Gray Hat:** Gray hat hackers know the techniques and methods used by malicious hackers and recognize the tools and software used during hacker activities. They are computer experts who sometimes may violate the law but generally operate within legal bounds and uphold ethical standards.

Ref: [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grey_hat)

This group stands somewhere between ethical and unethical hacking. They may access systems without authorization but usually report the security vulnerabilities they find to the respective organization to show goodwill. Their intentions may not be entirely malicious, but their methods are questionable.

Ethical Hacker

Ethical hackers fall under the category of white hat hackers.

The role of ethical hackers is to test and strengthen the security of computer systems, networks, and data.

### Questions

##### Q: What is the sum of the squares of the numbers from 1 to 100?
A: 338350

Explanation: The first method that might come to mind to solve this problem is to take the squares of each number from 1 to 100 and sum them up one by one. However, using the formula
`n * (n + 1) * (2 * n + 1) / 6` allows for a much faster solution, stepping outside the usual approach—what we can call a mathematical **hack**.
