## Introduction

Information is typically characterized by the highest possible degree of certainty, assumed to be accurate and valid, and available to individuals or groups.

Ref: [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knowledge)

The most important feature of information is that it provides us with meaning and context about the world around us. For example, when we read a book or talk to someone, we learn new information and use this information to shape our thoughts and behaviors.

### Information Security

Information security involves protecting information from unauthorized use, disclosure, destruction, alteration, damage, or preventing unauthorized access to it.

Ref: [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_security)

We can also define information security as the set of measures taken to prevent information from being harmed in the wrong hands.

### Principles of Information Security: The CIA Triad

**Confidentiality:** Ensures that information is accessible only to authorized individuals and prevents others from viewing it.

**Integrity:** Means that information remains accurate and unchanged, preventing it from being accidentally or intentionally altered.

**Availability:** Ensures that information is easily accessible to authorized users when needed.

Information security encompasses the protection of both physical documents and electronic data. This includes a wide range of measures, from encryption techniques to access control systems and antivirus software.

Today, especially with the widespread use of the internet, information security is of vital importance for both individuals and organizations.
