## Introduction

Information is typically characterized by the highest possible degree of certainty, assumed to be accurate and valid, and available to individuals or groups.

Ref: [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knowledge)

The most important feature of information is that it provides us with meaning and context about the world around us. For example, when we read a book or talk to someone, we learn new information and use this information to shape our thoughts and behaviors.

### Questions

##### Q: What is the sum of the squares of the numbers from 1 to 100?
A: 338350

Explanation: The first method that might come to mind to solve this problem is to take the squares of each number from 1 to 100 and sum them up one by one. However, using the formula
`n * (n + 1) * (2 * n + 1) / 6` allows for a much faster solution, stepping outside the usual approach—what we can call a mathematical **hack**.

## Penetration Testing (Pentest)

[[THM - PENTENSTING FUNDAMENTALS#^f0a56c]]
Penetration testing is the process of identifying potential security vulnerabilities in an organization's software, systems, and IT infrastructure by simulating real-world cyber attacks. These tests help organizations strengthen their defenses, identify critical vulnerabilities ahead of time, and minimize the impact of a potential security breach.

Penetration tests are conducted within the framework of a contract signed between the organization requesting the test and the organization performing the test. This contract ensures that the test activities are conducted legally and defines the scope of the test. Only the components specified in the contract may be tested, ensuring that the process adheres to both legal and ethical standards.

Professionals involved in penetration testing are usually referred to as "pentesters," "penetration testers," or "cybersecurity experts." These professionals conduct tests within the scope of their given authority using an ethical hacker approach and report the security vulnerabilities they identify.
<div>
<br>
</div>

### Types of Penetration Testing

Penetration tests can be classified into three main categories based on the level of information provided: White Box, Grey Box, and Black Box.

#### White Box

The team conducting the test is given comprehensive information and authority about the system. This approach allows for an in-depth analysis and testing of the system.

#### Grey Box

The team performing the test is provided with partial information and authority about the system. This creates a more realistic test scenario and demonstrates how pentesters can progress with partial information.

#### Black Box

The test team conducts the test without any prior knowledge about the system. This offers the most realistic scenario from the perspective of an actual attacker.
