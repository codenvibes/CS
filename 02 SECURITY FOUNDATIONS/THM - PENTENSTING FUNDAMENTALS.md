## 1. What is Penetration Testing?

Before teaching you the technical hands-on aspects of ethical hacking, you'll need to understand more about what a penetration tester's job responsibilities are and what processes are followed in performing pentests (finding vulnerabilities in a clients application or system).

The importance and relevancy of cybersecurity are ever-increasing and can be in every walk of life. News headlines fill our screens, reporting yet another hack or data leak.  

Cybersecurity is relevant to all people in the modern world, including a strong password policy to protect your emails or to businesses and other organisations needing to protect both devices and data from damages.

==A DEF-Penetration test or pentest is a **simulated cyberattack** conducted to identify vulnerabilities and evaluate the **security posture** of a system, network, or application.==
A penetration test involves using the same tools, techniques, and methodologies that someone with malicious intent would use and is similar to an audit.  

According to [Security Magazine](https://www.securitymagazine.com/articles/87787-hackers-attack-every-39-seconds), a cybersecurity industry magazine, there are over 2,200 cyber attacks every day - 1 attack every 39 seconds.
