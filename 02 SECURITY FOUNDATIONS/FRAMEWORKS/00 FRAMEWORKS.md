In cybersecurity, **frameworks** are structured sets of guidelines, best practices, and standardized processes that help you **understand, prevent, detect, and respond** to security threats in an organized way.

> If cybersecurity was like cooking:
> - A **framework** is the _recipe book_.
> - The **tools** are your pots, pans, knives (nmap, Wireshark, etc.).
> - The **ingredients** are your raw data, logs, vulnerabilities, and incidents.

Think of them as **maps or playbooks**:
- They **organize knowledge** (e.g., lists of attack techniques, defense methods, policies).
- They **standardize language** so everyone—analysts, engineers, managers—can talk about security in the same terms.
- They **guide actions** so you don’t reinvent the wheel every time you face a threat.

**Framework Types;**
1. **Knowledge-based frameworks** – They describe _what exists_.
    - Example: **MITRE ATT&CK** catalogs the tactics and techniques attackers use.
    - You use them for threat intelligence, analysis, and training.
2. **Process-based frameworks** – They describe _what to do_.
    - Example: **NIST Cybersecurity Framework** gives a lifecycle (Identify → Protect → Detect → Respond → Recover).
    - You use them to structure security programs and incident response.
