## Task 1. Introduction

The term **kill chain** is a military concept related to the structure of an attack. It consists of target identification, decision and order to attack the target, and finally the target destruction.

Thanks to Lockheed Martin, a global security and aerospace company, that established the Cyber Kill Chain® framework for the cybersecurity industry in 2011 based on the military concept. The framework defines the steps used by adversaries or malicious actors in cyberspace. To succeed, an adversary needs to go through all phases of the Kill Chain. We will go through the attack phases and help you better understand adversaries and their techniques used in the attack to defend yourself.

So, why is it important to understand how Cyber Kill Chain works?

The Cyber Kill Chain will help you understand and protect against ransomware attacks, security breaches as well as Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs). You can use the Cyber Kill Chain to assess your network and system security by identifying missing security controls and closing certain security gaps based on your company's infrastructure.

By understanding the Kill Chain as a SOC Analyst, Security Researcher, Threat Hunter, or Incident Responder, you will be able to recognize the intrusion attempts and understand the intruder's goals and objectives. 

We will be exploring the following attack phases in this room:

- Reconnaissance
- Weaponization
- Delivery
- Exploitation
- Installation
- Command & Control
- Actions on Objectives

### Learning Objectives

In this room, you will learn about each phase of the Cyber Kill Chain Framework, the advantages and disadvantages of the traditional Cyber Kill Chain. 

Outcome  
As a result, you will be ready to recognize different phases or stages of the attack carried out by an adversary and be able to break the "kill chain."
