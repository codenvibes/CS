## 1. Introduction

In this room, we are going to be going over some means of identifying vulnerabilities and coupling our research skills to learn how these can be abused.

Additionally, you will find some publicly available resources that are essential additions to your skill set and tools when performing vulnerability research and exploitation. You will then get to apply all of this into a practical challenge at the end of the room.

## 2. Automated Vs. Manual Vulnerability Research

There is a myriad of tools and services available in cybersecurity for vulnerability scanning. Ranging from being commercial (and footing a heavy bill) to open-source and free, vulnerability scanners are convenient means of quickly canvassing an application for flaws.
<div align="center"><br><img src="https://tryhackme-images.s3.amazonaws.com/user-uploads/5de96d9ca744773ea7ef8c00/room-content/a875f0744fa4e296c34693eec4fe623d.png"></div>

For example, the vulnerability scanner [Nessus](https://www.tenable.com/products/nessus) has both a free (community) edition and commercial. The commercial version costing thousands of pounds for a year's license will likely be used in organisations providing penetration testing services or audits. If you’d like to know more about Nessus, check out the TryHackMe [room](https://tryhackme.com/room/rpnessusredux) dedicated to it.

I have detailed some of the advantages and disadvantages of using a vulnerability scanner in the table below:

| **Advantage**                                                                                               | **Disadvantage**                                                                                                                          |
| ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Automated scans are easy to repeat, and the results can be shared within a team with ease.                  | People can often become reliant on these tools.                                                                                           |
| These scanners are quick and can test numerous applications efficiently.                                    | They are extremely "loud" and produce a lot of traffic and logging. This is not good if you are trying to bypass firewalls and the likes. |
| Open-source solutions exist.                                                                                | Open-source solutions are often basic and require expensive licenses to have useful features.                                             |
| Automated scanners cover a wide range of different vulnerabilities that may be hard to manually search for. | They often do not find every vulnerability on an application.                                                                             |

  

Frameworks such as Metasploit often have vulnerability scanners for some modules; this is something you will come onto learn about in a further module in this pathway.

  

Manual scanning for vulnerabilities is often the weapon of choice by a penetration tester when testing individual applications or programs. In fact, manual scanning will involve searching for the same vulnerabilities and uses similar techniques as automated scanning.

  

Ultimately, both techniques involve testing an application or program for vulnerabilities. These vulnerabilities include:

  

|   |   |
|---|---|
|**Vulnerability**|**Description**|
|Security Misconfigurations|Security misconfigurations involve vulnerabilities that are due to developer oversight. For example, exposing server information in messages between the application and an attacker.|
|Broken Access Control|This vulnerability occurs when an attacker is able to access parts of an application that they are not supposed to be able to otherwise.|
|Insecure Deserialization|This is the insecure processing of data that is sent across an application. An attacker may be able to pass malicious code to the application, where it will then be executed.|
|Injection|An Injection vulnerability exists when an attacker is able to input malicious data into an application. This is due to the failure of not ensuring (known as sanitising) input is not harmful.|

If you are keen to learn more about these vulnerabilities, the [OWASP framework](https://owasp.org/www-project-top-ten/) will be a useful read to you. TryHackMe even has a [room](https://tryhackme.com/room/owasptop10) showcasing the top ten vulnerabilities outlined by OWASP.
