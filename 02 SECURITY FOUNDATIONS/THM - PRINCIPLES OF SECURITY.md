## 1. Introduction

The following room is going to outline some of the fundamental principles of information security. The frameworks used to protect data and systems to the elements of what exactly makes data secure.

The measures, frameworks and protocols discussed throughout this room all play a small part in "Defence in Depth."

Defence in Depth is a security strategy that uses multiple layers of defensive mechanisms to protect systems, networks, and data. The idea is that if one security control fails or is bypassed, additional layers continue to provide protection.
