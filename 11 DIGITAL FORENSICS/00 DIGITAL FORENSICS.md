==**DEF-Digital forensics** is the process of identifying, preserving, analyzing, and presenting digital evidence in a way that is legally admissible.==

> In the context of law, "admissible" refers to evidence that a court deems acceptable for consideration in a trial. It means the evidence is relevant to the case, reliable, and legally obtained. Inadmissible evidence, on the other hand, is excluded because it's deemed unreliable, unfairly prejudicial, or illegally obtained, and therefore not allowed to be presented to the judge or jury.

It is used in investigations involving cybercrime, data breaches, fraud, or any incident where digital devices like computers, phones, or servers might contain relevant evidence.

### Key aspects of digital forensics:

- **Identification**: Finding digital evidence (e.g. files, emails, logs).
- **Preservation**: Ensuring data is not altered or damaged.
- **Analysis**: Extracting meaningful information using forensic tools.
- **Documentation**: Recording the process to maintain a chain of custody.
- **Presentation**: Reporting findings clearly, often for use in court or incident response.

### Example use cases:

- Tracing the origin of a cyberattack
- Recovering deleted files
- Investigating unauthorized access
- Uncovering insider threats
