| **Slide**                                                   | **Content**                                                                                                                                                                                                            |

| **Slide 2 – Learning Objectives / Agenda**                  | Outline: ✅ Understand what OWASP Top 10 is ✅ Explore key vulnerabilities through a real case ✅ Watch a short demo ✅ Learn practical mitigations ✅ End with a quick quiz                                                |
| **Slide 3 – What is OWASP?**                                | Briefly explain OWASP and its mission. Show the OWASP Top 10 logo + quote: “A standard awareness document for developers and security professionals.”                                                                  |
| **Slide 4 – Overview of the OWASP Top 10**                  | Visual summary (pyramid or grid) listing all 10 categories. Use simple icons and color coding. Add note: “Full cheat sheet & detailed notes linked at the end.”                                                        |
| **Slide 5 – Deep Dive: Example 1 – Broken Access Control**  | Quick explanation: what it is, common mistakes, and real-world risk. Show one-liner example (e.g., insecure direct object reference).                                                                                  |
| **Slide 6 – Deep Dive: Example 2 – Injection / XSS (Demo)** | 1-min **explainer animation** showing how a small input can lead to SQL Injection or XSS. Follow with 1-min live or recorded demo showing the vulnerability and fix.                                                   |
| **Slide 7 – Real-World Case Study**                         | Example: **Equifax 2017 breach** (caused by OWASP A9: Using Components with Known Vulnerabilities). Explain in 3 lines: _What happened_, _which OWASP category it relates to_, _the business impact_.                  |
| **Slide 8 – Prevention & Best Practices**                   | Show key mitigations (e.g., input validation, least privilege, secure dependencies). Maybe a “Security by Design” checklist. Include link to **cheat sheet** & **longer version** of notes.                            |
| **Slide 9 – Mini Quiz / Reflection**                        | Title: “🕵️ Spot the Vulnerability!” Show a short code snippet or screenshot and ask: _“What’s wrong here?”_ Engage the panel briefly with options A–B–C.                                                              |
