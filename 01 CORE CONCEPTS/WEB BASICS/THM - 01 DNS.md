## 1. What is DNS?

DNS (Domain Name System) provides a simple way for us to communicate with devices on the internet without remembering complex numbers. Much like every house has a unique address for sending mail directly to it, every computer on the internet has its own unique address to communicate with it called an IP address. An IP address looks like the following 104.26.10.229, 4 sets of digits ranging from 0 - 255 separated by a period. When you want to visit a website, it's not exactly convenient to remember this complicated set of numbers, and that's where DNS can help. So instead of remembering 104.26.10.229, you can remember [tryhackme.com](http://tryhackme.com/) instead.

==**DEF-DNS** stands for **Domain Name System**. It's like the internet's phonebook. DNS translates **domain names** (like `www.google.com`) into **IP addresses** (like `142.250.190.68`) that computers use to identify each other on the network.
Humans remember names like `example.com`, but computers talk using numbers (IP addresses). DNS makes it easier for us to browse the web without needing to memorize those numbers.==

**How DNS works (basic steps):**
1. **You type a website URL** in your browser (`www.example.com`).
2. **Your computer asks a DNS server** to find the IP address of that domain.
3. **The DNS server responds** with the IP address.
4. **Your browser connects** to that IP address and loads the website.

Think of DNS like your phone's contacts list:
- You search for “Mom” (domain name).
- Your phone finds her number (IP address) and calls her.
