## 1. Introduction

The [Protocols and Servers](https://tryhackme.com/room/protocolsandservers) room covered many protocols:

- Telnet
- HTTP
- FTP
- SMTP
- POP3
- IMAP

Servers implementing these protocols are subject to different kinds of attacks. To name a few, consider:

1. Sniffing Attack (Network Packet Capture)
2. Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) Attack
3. Password Attack (Authentication Attack)
4. Vulnerabilities

From a security perspective, we always need to think about what we aim to protect; consider the security triad: Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability (CIA). **Confidentiality** refers to keeping the contents of the communications accessible to the intended parties. **Integrity** is the idea of assuring any data sent is accurate, consistent, and complete when reaching its destination. Finally, **availability** refers to being able to access the service when we need it. Different parties will put varying emphasis on these three. For instance, confidentiality would be the highest priority for an intelligence agency. Online banking will put most emphasis on the integrity of transactions. Availability is of the highest importance for any platform making money by serving ads.

Knowing that we are protecting the Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability (CIA), an attack aims to cause Disclosure, Alteration, and Destruction (DAD). The figures below reflect this.

These attacks directly affect the security of the system. For instance, network packet capture violates confidentiality and leads to the disclosure of information. A successful password attack can also lead to disclosure. On the other hand, a Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) attack breaks the system’s integrity as it can alter the communicated data. We will focus on these three attacks in this room as these attacks are integral to the protocol design and server implementation.

Vulnerabilities are of a broader spectrum, and exploited vulnerabilities have different impacts on the target systems. For instance, exploiting a Denial of Service (DoS) vulnerability can affect the system’s availability, while exploiting a Remote Code Execution (RCE) vulnerability can lead to more severe damages. It is important to note that a vulnerability by itself creates a risk; damage can occur only when the vulnerability is exploited. We don’t cover vulnerabilities in this room as they have their own module, [Vulnerability Research](https://tryhackme.com/module/vulnerability-research).

This room will focus on how a protocol can be upgraded or replaced to protect against disclosure and alteration, i.e. protecting the confidentiality and integrity of the transmitted data. We will be recommending other modules that cover additional topics.

Moreover, we introduce Hydra to find weak passwords.
