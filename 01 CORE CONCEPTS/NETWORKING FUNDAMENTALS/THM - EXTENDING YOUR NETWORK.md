#THM-PRE_SECURITY #2-NETWORK_FUNDAMENTALS

## 1. Introduction to Port Forwarding

Port forwarding is an essential component in connecting applications and services to the Internet. Without port forwarding, applications and services such as web servers are only available to devices within the same direct network.

==DEF-Port forwarding is a **networking technique** that allows external devices (from the internet) to access specific services or devices inside a private network.==

Port forwarding opens a “door” into your network.

Here’s the idea:
- Your **router** sits between the internet and your local devices (PCs, consoles, cameras, servers).
- By default, the router **blocks unsolicited inbound traffic** from the internet for security.
- **Port forwarding** tells the router:
    > “If someone from the internet tries to connect on this port number, send that traffic to this specific device inside my network.”

**Example: Security Camera Access**

Imagine you have a **Wi-Fi security camera** at home, and you want to check the live feed when you’re at work.
- The camera is connected to your home network and streams video on **port 8080**.
- From inside your house, you can watch the feed by typing `192.168.1.50:8080` in your browser.
- But when you’re outside (on mobile data or office Wi-Fi), that local IP address doesn’t work—it only exists inside your home network.

**Solution: Port Forwarding**
- You log into your router and set up a port forwarding rule:
    > “Forward all incoming traffic on port 8080 from the internet to the camera at 192.168.1.50:8080.”
- Now, if you type your home’s **public IP address** (like `73.25.120.44:8080`) from anywhere in the world, the router will forward that request directly to your camera.

Take the network below as an example. Within this network, the server with an IP address of "192.168.1.10" runs a webserver on port 80. Only the two other computers on this network will be able to access it (this is known as an intranet).

If the administrator wanted the website to be accessible to the public (using the Internet), they would have to implement port forwarding, like in the diagram below:
<div align="center"><br><img width="900" src="https://tryhackme-images.s3.amazonaws.com/user-uploads/5de96d9ca744773ea7ef8c00/room-content/eb63570eb9f31d26ebd8207ec08058bc.svg" alt=""></div>

With this design, Network #2 will now be able to access the webserver running on Network #1 using the public IP address of Network #1 (82.62.51.70).

It is easy to confuse port forwarding with the behaviours of a firewall (a technology we'll come on to discuss in a later task). However, at this stage, just understand that port forwarding opens specific ports (recall how packets work). In comparison, firewalls determine if traffic can travel across these ports (even if these ports are open by port forwarding).

Port forwarding is configured at the router of a network.

==A **DEF-firewall** is a security system—either hardware, software, or both—that **monitors and controls network traffic** based on predefined rules.==

A firewall is a device within a network responsible for determining what traffic is allowed to enter and exit. Think of a firewall as border security for a network. An administrator can configure a firewall to **permit** or **deny** traffic from entering or exiting a network based on numerous factors such as:

- Where the traffic is coming from? (has the firewall been told to accept/deny traffic from a specific network?)
- Where is the traffic going to? (has the firewall been told to accept/deny traffic destined for a specific network?)
- What port is the traffic for? (has the firewall been told to accept/deny traffic destined for port 80 only?)
- What protocol is the traffic using? (has the firewall been told to accept/deny traffic that is UDP, TCP or both?)

Firewalls perform packet inspection to determine the answers to these questions.

Firewalls come in all shapes and sizes. From dedicated pieces of hardware (often found in large networks like businesses) that can handle a magnitude of data to residential routers (like at your home!) or software such as [Snort](https://www.snort.org/), firewalls can be categorised into 2 to 5 categories.

We'll cover the two primary categories of firewalls in the table below:

| **Firewall Category** | **Description**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |

| Stateful              | This type of firewall uses the entire information from a connection; rather than inspecting an individual packet, this firewall determines the behaviour of a device **based upon the entire connection**.<br><br>This firewall type consumes many resources in comparison to stateless firewalls as the decision making is dynamic. For example, a firewall could allow the first parts of a TCP handshake that would later fail.<br><br>If a connection from a host is bad, it will block the entire device.                                                                                                                                      |
| Stateless             | This firewall type uses a static set of rules to determine whether or not **individual packets** are acceptable or not. For example, a device sending a bad packet will not necessarily mean that the entire device is then blocked.<br><br>Whilst these firewalls use much fewer resources than alternatives, they are much dumber. For example, these firewalls are only effective as the rules that are defined within them. If a rule is not exactly matched, it is effectively useless.<br><br>However, these firewalls are great when receiving large amounts of traffic from a set of hosts (such as a Distributed Denial-of-Service attack) |
