A `Vulnerability Assessment` aims to identify and categorize risks for security weaknesses related to assets within an environment. It is important to note that `there is little to no manual exploitation during a vulnerability assessment`. A vulnerability assessment also provides remediation steps to fix the issues.

The purpose of a `Vulnerability Assessment` is to understand, identify, and categorize the risk for the more apparent issues present in an environment without actually exploiting them to gain further access. Depending on the scope of the assessment, some customers may ask us to validate as many vulnerabilities as possible by performing minimally invasive exploitation to confirm the scanner findings and rule out false positives. Other customers will ask for a report of all findings identified by the scanner. As with any assessment, it is essential to clarify the scope and intent of the vulnerability assessment before starting. Vulnerability management is vital to help organizations identify the weak points in their assets, understand the risk level, and calculate and prioritize remediation efforts.

It is also important to note that organizations should always test substantial patches before pushing them out into their environment to prevent disruptions.

## Methodology

Below is a sample vulnerability assessment methodology that most organizations could follow and find success with. Methodologies may vary slightly from organization to organization, but this chart covers the main steps, from identifying assets to creating a remediation plan.

## Understanding Key Terms

### Vulnerability
(weaknesses that could lead to a threat)
==A Vulnerability is a weakness or bug in an organization's environment, including applications, networks, and infrastructure, that opens up the possibility of threats from external actors.==

Vulnerabilities can be registered through MITRE's [Common Vulnerability Exposure database](https://cve.mitre.org/) and receive a [Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss/v3-calculator) score to determine severity. This scoring system is frequently used as a standard for companies and governments looking to calculate accurate and consistent severity scores for their systems' vulnerabilities. Scoring vulnerabilities in this way helps prioritize resources and determine how to respond to a given threat. Scores are calculated using metrics such as the type of attack vector (network, adjacent, local, physical), the attack complexity, privileges required, whether or not the attack requires user interaction, and the impact of successful exploitation on an organization's confidentiality, integrity, and availability of data. Scores can range from 0 to 10, depending on these metrics.

#### Scenario: Online Retail Store Using Outdated Software

| Term          | Example |
| ------------- | ------- |
| Threat        |         |
| Vulnerability |         |
| Risk          |         |

##### Threat
A cybercriminal group launches a phishing campaign that includes malware designed to steal credit card information from e-commerce websites.
##### Vulnerability
The online store is running an outdated version of its shopping cart plugin that contains an unpatched security flaw allowing remote code execution.
##### Risk
There is a high risk that customer credit card data will be stolen if the malware is able to exploit the outdated plugin, leading to data breaches, financial loss, and reputational damage for the business.

### Threat
A `Threat` is a process that amplifies the potential of an adverse event, such as a threat actor exploiting a vulnerability. Some vulnerabilities raise more threat concerns over others due to the probability of the vulnerability being exploited. For example, the higher the reward of the outcome and ease of exploitation, the more likely the issue would be exploited by threat actors.

### Exploit
(something bad that is happening)
An `Exploit` is any code or resources that can be used to take advantage of an asset's weakness. Many exploits are available through open-source platforms such as [Exploit-db](https://exploit-db.com/) or [the Rapid7 Vulnerability and Exploit Database](https://www.rapid7.com/db/). We will often see exploit code hosted on sites such as GitHub and GitLab as well.

### Risk
(something bad that could happen)
`Risk` is the possibility of assets or data being harmed or destroyed by threat actors.
