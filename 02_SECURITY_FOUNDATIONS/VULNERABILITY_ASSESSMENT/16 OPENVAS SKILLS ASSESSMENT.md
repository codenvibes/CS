You have been contracted by the company `Inlanefreight` to perform an internal vulnerability assessment against one of their servers. They have asked for a cursory assessment to be performed to identify any significant vulnerabilities as they do not have the budget for a full-scale penetration test this year. The results of this vulnerability assessment may enable the CISO to push for additional funding from the Board of Directors to perform more in-depth security testing.

The target server is a Linux Server host.

## Requirements

Navigate to the OpenVAS web interface at the server below and log in with the provided credentials.

Once logged in, create a new task with the `OpenVAS Default` Scanner and use the `Full and Fast` config against the target: `172.16.16.160`. Additionally, ensure you have the scan set up to run as an authenticated user using the credentials: `root:HTB_@cademy_admin!`.

The scan will take up to 60 minutes to finish.

_Note: It may take 1-2 minutes for your target instance to spawn._

Alternatively, use the pre-populated scan data to answer the questions below without having to wait for the scan to finish but feel free to practice configuring and running it.

**Reminder:** OpenVAS can be accessed at `https://< IP >:8080`. The OpenVAS credentials are: `htb-student`:`HTB_@cademy_student!`. You may also use these credentials to SSH into the target VM to configure OpenVAS.
