A `Vulnerability Assessment` aims to identify and categorize risks for security weaknesses related to assets within an environment. It is important to note that `there is little to no manual exploitation during a vulnerability assessment`. A vulnerability assessment also provides remediation steps to fix the issues.

The purpose of a `Vulnerability Assessment` is to understand, identify, and categorize the risk for the more apparent issues present in an environment without actually exploiting them to gain further access. Depending on the scope of the assessment, some customers may ask us to validate as many vulnerabilities as possible by performing minimally invasive exploitation to confirm the scanner findings and rule out false positives. Other customers will ask for a report of all findings identified by the scanner. As with any assessment, it is essential to clarify the scope and intent of the vulnerability assessment before starting. Vulnerability management is vital to help organizations identify the weak points in their assets, understand the risk level, and calculate and prioritize remediation efforts.

It is also important to note that organizations should always test substantial patches before pushing them out into their environment to prevent disruptions.

## Methodology

Below is a sample vulnerability assessment methodology that most organizations could follow and find success with. Methodologies may vary slightly from organization to organization, but this chart covers the main steps, from identifying assets to creating a remediation plan.

## Understanding Key Terms

### Vulnerability
==A **flaw or weakness** in a system, process, or control that can be **exploited** by a **threat** to compromise the confidentiality, integrity, or availability of an asset.==

Vulnerabilities can be registered through MITRE's [Common Vulnerability Exposure database](https://cve.mitre.org/) and receive a [Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss/v3-calculator) score to determine severity. This scoring system is frequently used as a standard for companies and governments looking to calculate accurate and consistent severity scores for their systems' vulnerabilities. Scoring vulnerabilities in this way helps prioritize resources and determine how to respond to a given threat. Scores are calculated using metrics such as the type of attack vector (network, adjacent, local, physical), the attack complexity, privileges required, whether or not the attack requires user interaction, and the impact of successful exploitation on an organization's confidentiality, integrity, and availability of data. Scores can range from 0 to 10, depending on these metrics.

#### Scenario: Online Retail Store Using Outdated Software

| Term          | Example                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Threat        | A cybercriminal group launches a phishing campaign that includes malware designed to steal credit card information from e-commerce websites.                                                                  |
| Vulnerability | The online store is running an outdated version of its shopping cart plugin that contains an unpatched security flaw allowing remote code execution.                                                          |
| Risk          | There is a high risk that customer credit card data will be stolen if the malware is able to exploit the outdated plugin, leading to data breaches, financial loss, and reputational damage for the business. |

### Threat
==A **potential cause** of an unwanted incident that may result in harm to an asset, system or organization. It is the **intent** or **capability** to exploit a vulnerability.== Some vulnerabilities raise more threat concerns over others due to the probability of the vulnerability being exploited. For example, the higher the reward of the outcome and ease of exploitation, the more likely the issue would be exploited by threat actors.

### Exploit
==A **tool, technique, or piece of code** used by a threat actor to **take advantage of a vulnerability present on the target system.**== Many exploits are available through open-source platforms such as [Exploit-db](https://exploit-db.com/) or [the Rapid7 Vulnerability and Exploit Database](https://www.rapid7.com/db/). We will often see exploit code hosted on sites such as GitHub and GitLab as well.

### Risk
==The potential for loss or damage when a threat exploits a vulnerability. Risk is often calculated as:
**Risk is a combination of threat, vulnerability, and potential impact**.==

## Asset Management

When an organization of any kind, in any industry, and of any size needs to plan their cybersecurity strategy, they should start by creating an inventory of their `data assets`. If you want to protect something, you must first know what you are protecting! Once assets have been inventoried, then you can start the process of `asset management`. This is a key concept in defensive security.

### Asset Inventory
`Asset inventory` is a critical component of vulnerability management. An organization needs to understand what assets are in its network to provide the proper protection and set up appropriate defenses. The asset inventory should include information technology, operational technology, physical, software, mobile, and development assets. Organizations can utilize asset management tools to keep track of assets. The assets should have data classifications to ensure adequate security and access controls.

### Application and System Inventory
An organization should create a thorough and complete inventory of data assets for proper asset management for defensive security. Data assets include:

- All data stored on-premises. HDDs and SSDs in endpoints (PCs and mobile devices), HDDs & SSDs in servers, external drives in the local network, optical media (DVDs, Blu-ray discs, CDs), flash media (USB sticks, SD cards). Legacy technology may include floppy disks, ZIP drives (a relic from the 1990s), and tape drives.

- All of the data storage that their cloud provider possesses. [Amazon Web Services](https://aws.amazon.com/) (`AWS`), [Google Cloud Platform](https://cloud.google.com/) (`GCP`), and [Microsoft Azure](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/) are some of the most popular cloud providers, but there are many more. Sometimes corporate networks are "multi-cloud," meaning they have more than one cloud provider. A company's cloud provider will provide tools that can be used to inventory all of the data stored by that particular cloud provider.

- All data stored within various `Software-as-a-Service (SaaS)` applications. This data is also "in the cloud" but might not all be within the scope of a corporate cloud provider account. These are often consumer services or the "business" version of those services. Think of online services such as `Google Drive`, `Dropbox`, `Microsoft Teams`, `Apple iCloud`, `Adobe Creative Suite`, `Microsoft Office 365`, `Google Docs`, and the list goes on.

- All of the applications a company needs to use to conduct their usual operation and business. Including applications that are deployed locally and applications that are deployed through the cloud or are otherwise Software-as-a-Service.

- All of a company's on-premises computer networking devices. These include but aren't limited to `routers`, `firewalls`, `hubs`, `switches`, dedicated `intrusion detection` and `prevention systems` (`IDS/IPS`), `data loss prevention` (`DLP`) systems, and so on.
