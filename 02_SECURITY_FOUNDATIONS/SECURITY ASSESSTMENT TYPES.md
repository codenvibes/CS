The primary purpose of most types of security assessments is to find and confirm vulnerabilities are present, so we can work to `patch`, `mitigate`, or `remove` them. There are different ways and methodologies to test how secure a computer system is.

Some types of security assessments are more appropriate for certain networks than others. But they all serve a purpose in improving cybersecurity. All organizations have different compliance requirements and risk tolerance, face different threats, and have different business models that determine the types of systems they run externally and internally. Some organizations have a much more mature security posture than their peers and can focus on advanced red team simulations conducted by third parties, while others are still working to establish baseline security. Regardless, all organizations must stay on top of both legacy and recent vulnerabilities and have a system for detecting and mitigating risks to their systems and data.

## Vulnerability Assessment

`Vulnerability assessments` are appropriate for all organizations and networks. A vulnerability assessment is based on a particular security standard, and compliance with these standards is analyzed (e.g., going through a checklist).

A vulnerability assessment can be based on various security standards. Which standards apply to a particular network will depend on many factors. These factors can include industry-specific and regional data security regulations, the size and form of a company's network, which types of applications they use or develop, and their security maturity level.

Vulnerability assessments may be performed independently or alongside other security assessments depending on an organization's situation.

## Penetration Test

A pentest is a type of simulated cyber attack, and pentesters conduct actions that a threat actor may perform to see if certain kinds of exploits are possible.

The key difference between a pentest and an actual cyber attack is that the former is done with the full legal consent of the entity being pentested. Whether a pentester is an employee or a third-party contractor, they will need to sign a lengthy legal document with the target company that describes what they're allowed to do and what they're not allowed to do. As with a vulnerability assessment, an effective pentest will result in a detailed report full of information that can be used to improve a network's security.

### Pentests based on By Access Level:
| Type          | Pentester's Knowledge      | Simulates                   | Common Use Case                 | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |

| **Black Box** | No prior knowledge         | External attacker           | Public-facing attack simulation | Black box pentesting is done with no knowledge of a network's configuration or applications. Typically a tester will either be given network access (or an ethernet port and have to bypass Network Access Control NAC) and nothing else (requiring them to perform their own discovery for IP addresses) if the pentest is internal, or nothing more than the company name if the pentest is from an external standpoint. This type of pentesting is usually conducted by third parties from the perspective of an external attacker. Often the customer will ask the pentester to show them discovered internal/external IP addresses/network ranges so they can confirm ownership and note down any hosts that should be considered out-of-scope. |
| **Grey Box**  | Limited/internal knowledge | Insider or compromised user | Balance of realism and depth    | Grey box pentesting is done with a little bit of knowledge of the network they're testing, from a perspective equivalent to an employee who doesn't work in the IT department, such as a receptionist or customer service agent. The customer will typically give the tester in-scope network ranges or individual IP addresses in a grey box situation.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| **White Box** | Full system knowledge      | Internal audit              | Thorough security assessment    | White box pentesting is typically conducted by giving the penetration tester full access to all systems, configurations, build documents, etc., and source code if web applications are in-scope. The goal here is to discover as many flaws as possible that would be difficult or impossible to discover blindly in a reasonable amount of time.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |

### Pentests based on Scope/Target:

Often, pentesters specialize in a particular area. Penetration testers must have knowledge of many different technologies but still will usually have a specialty.

| Type                               | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   | Example Targets                       |

| **Physical Pentest**               | Physical pentesters try to leverage physical security weaknesses and breakdowns in processes to gain access to a facility such as a data center or office building.<br><br>- Can you open a door in an unintended way?<br>- Can you tailgate someone into the data center?<br>- Can you crawl through a vent? | Entry points, locks, USB ports        |

### Pentests based on Evasion/Stealth Techniques:

Penetration tests can be categorized based on their **stealth** and **approach**, especially when discussing how detectable they are by security systems like firewalls, IDS (Intrusion Detection Systems), and endpoint protection tools.

| Type               | Stealth Level | Detectable by Security Tools? | Typical Use Case                         | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| ------------------ | ------------- | ----------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Non-Evasive**    | ❌ Low         | ✅ Yes                         | Test detection and response capabilities | Also called **standard** or **overt** pentesting.<br><br>**Goal**: Simulate a known, observable attack to test the effectiveness of security controls and response teams.<br><br>- **Characteristics**:<br>    - No attempt to hide attack traffic.<br>    - Focused on identifying vulnerabilities.<br>    - Likely to trigger alerts/logs on security tools.<br>- **Example Tools**: Nmap, Nessus (default settings), Metasploit (non-stealthy payloads). |
| **Evasive**        | ✅ High        | ❌ Rarely                      | Mimic stealthy real-world attackers      |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| **Hybrid Evasive** | ⚠️ Medium     | ⚠️ Sometimes                  | Mix of stealth and coverage              |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |


Pentesting is most appropriate for organizations with a medium or high security maturity level. Security maturity measures how well developed a company's cybersecurity program is, and security maturity takes years to build. It involves hiring knowledgeable cybersecurity professionals, having well-designed security policies and enforcement (such as configuration, patch, and vulnerability management), baseline hardening standards for all device types in the network, strong regulatory compliance, well-executed cyber incident response plans, a seasoned CSIRT (computer security incident response team), an established change control process, a CISO (chief information security officer), a CTO (chief technical officer), frequent security testing performed over the years, and strong security culture. Security culture is all about the attitude and habits employees have toward cybersecurity. Part of this can be taught through security awareness training programs and part by building security into the company's culture. Everyone, from secretaries to sysadmins to C-level staff, should be security conscious, understand how to avoid risky practices, and be educated on recognizing suspicious activity that should be reported to security staff.

Organizations with a lower security maturity level may want to focus on vulnerability assessments because a pentest could find too many vulnerabilities to be useful and could overwhelm staff tasked with remediation. Before penetration testing is considered, there should be a track record of vulnerability assessments and actions taken in response to vulnerability assessments.

## Vulnerability Assessments vs. Penetration Tests

| **Aspect**             | **Vulnerability Assessment**                                                 | **Penetration Test**                                                              |
| ---------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Definition**         | Identifies vulnerabilities without simulating attacks.                       | Simulates cyber attacks to evaluate security.                                     |
| **Purpose**            | To check for known vulnerabilities and misconfigurations.                    | To exploit vulnerabilities and assess real-world security impact.                 |
| **Approach**           | Follows a checklist or standard (e.g., GDPR, OWASP).                         | Uses manual and automated attacks (e.g., privilege escalation, lateral movement). |
| **Tools Used**         | Vulnerability scanners + validation tools.                                   | Tools for exploitation and simulation (e.g., Metasploit, custom scripts).         |
| **Level of Intrusion** | Non-intrusive – does not exploit vulnerabilities.                            | Intrusive – actively exploits vulnerabilities.                                    |
| **Validation**         | Confirms real vulnerabilities (not false positives) without exploiting them. | Demonstrates the extent and impact of successful exploitation.                    |
| **Frequency**          | Should be done regularly.                                                    | Should follow after vulnerability assessments and fixes.                          |
| **Outcome**            | A report of vulnerabilities ranked by severity.                              | A report on how attackers could exploit the environment.                          |
| **Best For**           | Ensuring security controls and configurations meet standards.                | Understanding the actual threat level and attack paths.                           |
| **Relationship**       | A precursor to penetration testing.                                          | Builds on vulnerability assessments.                                              |
| **Misconception**      | Not the same as a penetration test.                                          | Not “better” than a vulnerability assessment – they serve different purposes.     |
| **Use Together?**      | Yes, they complement each other and can be done in the same year.            | Yes, but only after vulnerability assessments and remediation.                    |

## Other Types of Security Assessments

Vulnerability assessments and penetration tests are not the only types of security assessments that an organization can perform to protect its assets. Other types of assessments may also be necessary, depending on the type of the organization.

| **Assessment Type**        | **Description**                                                                                                         | **Applicability / Context**                                                                                           | **Notable Details**                                                                                                                                                    |

| **Security Audits**        | Mandated evaluations of an organization’s compliance with external regulations or standards.                            | Typically required by government agencies or industry associations.                                                   | Example: PCI-DSS compliance audits for businesses accepting credit cards. Noncompliance can lead to fines or restrictions on payment method acceptance.                |
| **Bug Bounties**           | Programs inviting external individuals to find vulnerabilities in an organization’s applications.                       | Best suited for large organizations with high security maturity and ability to handle external vulnerability reports. | Payments can range from hundreds to hundreds of thousands of dollars. No automated scanning typically allowed. Example companies: Microsoft, Apple.                    |
| **Red Team Assessment**    | Offensive security teams simulate realistic cyber attacks to test an organization’s defenses.                           | Suitable for companies with larger budgets and higher security maturity.                                              | Focuses on completing a goal (e.g., accessing sensitive data) rather than listing all vulnerabilities. Internal red teams perform more focused and continuous testing. |
| **Purple Team Assessment** | Collaboration between offensive (red team) and defensive (blue team) security teams to enhance organizational security. | Used to foster real-time collaboration and improve security posture across departments.                               | Blue team learns and provides feedback during assessments. Example: Collaborating on PCI DSS compliance by watching red team test point-of-sale systems.               |
