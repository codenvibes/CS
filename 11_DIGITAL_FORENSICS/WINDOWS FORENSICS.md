### 1. Introduction to Windows Forensics

**Digital forensics** involves recovering and analyzing data from digital devices to investigate cyber incidents or crimes. **Computer forensics**, a subset, focuses on analyzing evidence from computers. It’s used in both legal cases and private investigations.

A perfect example of Digital Forensics solving a criminal case is the [BTK serial killer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dennis_Rader) case. This case had gone cold for more than a decade when the killer started taunting the police by sending letters. The case took a major turn when he sent a floppy disk to a local news station that was later taken to into evidence by the police. The police were able to recover a deleted word document on the drive, and using the metadata and some other evidence, they pinpointed and arrested him.

Because **Windows dominates the desktop OS market**, it’s vital for forensic analysts to understand how to extract evidence from it—especially using data from the **Windows Registry**.

#### DEF-Forensic Artifacts:

==An **artifact** is any piece of data or evidence left behind on a digital device that can help investigators understand what happened on that system. Just like fingerprints at a physical crime scene, digital artifacts are clues that help reconstruct the actions of a user or attacker on a computer or network.==

Artifacts can include:
- Browser history
- Log files
- Installed applications
- Deleted files
- Timestamps (like last login time)
- Registry entries (on Windows)
- System event logs

When performing forensic analysis, you will often hear the word 'artifact'. Forensic artifacts are essential pieces of information that provide evidence of human activity. For example, during the investigation of a crime scene, fingerprints, a broken button of a shirt or coat, the tools used to perform the crime are all considered forensic artifacts. All of these artifacts are combined to recreate the story of how the crime was committed. 

In computer forensics, forensic artifacts can be small footprints of activity left on the computer system. On a Windows system, a person's actions can be traced back quite accurately using computer forensics because of the various artifacts a Windows system creates for a given activity. These artifacts often reside in locations 'normal' users won't typically venture to. For our purposes, these artifacts can be analyzed to provide the trial of activity for an investigation.
