## WINDOWS FORENSICS 1

### 1. Introduction to Windows Forensics

**Digital forensics** involves recovering and analyzing data from digital devices to investigate cyber incidents or crimes. **Computer forensics**, a subset, focuses on analyzing evidence from computers. It’s used in both legal cases and private investigations.

A perfect example of Digital Forensics solving a criminal case is the [BTK serial killer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dennis_Rader) case. This case had gone cold for more than a decade when the killer started taunting the police by sending letters. The case took a major turn when he sent a floppy disk to a local news station that was later taken to into evidence by the police. The police were able to recover a deleted word document on the drive, and using the metadata and some other evidence, they pinpointed and arrested him.

Because **Windows dominates the desktop OS market**, it’s vital for forensic analysts to understand how to extract evidence from it—especially using data from the **Windows Registry**.

#### DEF-Forensic Artifacts:

==An **artifact** is any piece of data or evidence left behind on a digital device that can help investigators understand what happened on that system. Just like fingerprints at a physical crime scene, digital artifacts are clues that help reconstruct the actions of a user or attacker on a computer or network.==

Artifacts can include:
- Browser history
- Log files
- Installed applications
- Deleted files
- Timestamps (like last login time)
- Registry entries (on Windows)
- System event logs

In computer forensics, forensic artifacts can be small footprints of activity left on the computer system. On a Windows system, a person's actions can be traced back quite accurately using computer forensics because of the various artifacts a Windows system creates for a given activity. These artifacts often reside in locations 'normal' users won't typically venture to. For our purposes, these artifacts can be analyzed to provide the trial of activity for an investigation.

### 2. Windows Registry and Forensics

#### Windows Registry:

The Windows Registry is a collection of databases that contains the system's configuration data. This configuration data can be about the hardware, the software, or the user's information. It also includes data about the recently used files, programs used, or devices connected to the system. As you can understand, this data is beneficial from a forensics standpoint. Throughout this room, we will learn ways to read this data to identify the required information about the system. You can view the registry using regedit.exe, a built-in Windows utility to view and edit the registry. We'll explore other tools to learn about the registry in the upcoming tasks.

The Windows registry consists of Keys and Values. When you open the regedit.exe utility to view the registry, the folders you see are Registry Keys. Registry Values are the data stored in these Registry Keys. 

A [Registry Hive](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/sysinfo/registry-hives#:~:text=Registry%20Hives.%20A%20hive%20is%20a%20logical%20group,with%20a%20separate%20file%20for%20the%20user%20profile.) is a group of Keys, subkeys, and values stored in a single file on the disk.

#### Structure of the Registry:

The registry on any Windows system contains the following five root keys:

1. HKEY_CURRENT_USER
2. HKEY_USERS
3. HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE
4. HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT
5. HKEY_CURRENT_CONFIG

You can view these keys when you open the `regedit.exe` utility. To open the registry editor, press the Windows key and the R key simultaneously. It will open a `run` prompt that looks like this:

In this prompt, type `regedit.exe` , and you will be greeted with the registry editor window. It will look something like this:

Here you can see the root keys in the left pane in a tree view that shows the included registry keys, and the values in the selected key are shown in the right pane. You can right-click on the value shown in the right pane and select properties to view the properties of this value.

Here is how Microsoft defines each of these root keys. For more detail and information about the following Windows registry keys, please visit  [Microsoft's documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-US/troubleshoot/windows-server/performance/windows-registry-advanced-users) .

### 3. Accessing registry hives offline

If you are accessing a live system, you will be able to access the registry using regedit.exe, and you will be greeted with all of the standard root keys we learned about in the previous task. 

However, if you only have access to a disk image, you must know where the registry hives are located on the disk. The majority of these hives are located in the `C:\Windows\System32\Config` directory and are:

| Hive Name    | Mounted On                    | Description                                                                                |
| ------------ | ----------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **DEFAULT**  | `HKEY_USERS\DEFAULT`          | Default profile settings used when no user is logged in.                                   |
| **SAM**      | `HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SAM`      | **SAM** stands for **Security Account Manager**. Stores user account info and credentials. |
| **SECURITY** | `HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SECURITY` | Holds local security policies and settings.                                                |
| **SOFTWARE** | `HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE` | Installed software and configuration data.                                                 |
| **SYSTEM**   | `HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM`   | System settings, drivers, services, and startup info.                                      |

#### Hives containing user information:

Apart from these hives, two other hives containing user information can be found in the User profile directory. For Windows 7 and above, a user’s profile directory is located in `C:\Users\<username>\` where the hives are:

| Hive Name        | Mounted On                           | Location                                               | Description                                                  |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **NTUSER.DAT**   | `HKEY_CURRENT_USER`                  | `C:\Users\<username>\`                                 | User profile settings and preferences.                       |
| **USRCLASS.DAT** | `HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Classes` | `C:\Users\<username>\AppData\Local\Microsoft\Windows\` | User-specific file associations and COM class registrations. |

The USRCLASS.DAT hive is located in the directory `C:\Users\<username>\AppData\Local\Microsoft\Windows`.

The NTUSER.DAT hive is located in the directory `C:\Users\<username>\`.

Remember that NTUSER.DAT and USRCLASS.DAT are hidden files.

#### The Amcache Hive:

Apart from these files, there is another very important hive called the AmCache hive. This hive is located in `C:\Windows\AppCompat\Programs\Amcache.hve`. Windows creates this hive to save information on programs that were recently run on the system.

#### Transaction Logs and Backups:

Some other very vital sources of forensic data are the registry transaction logs and backups. The transaction logs can be considered as the journal of the changelog of the registry hive. Windows often uses transaction logs when writing data to registry hives. This means that the transaction logs can often have the latest changes in the registry that haven't made their way to the registry hives themselves. The transaction log for each hive is stored as a .LOG file in the same directory as the hive itself. It has the same name as the registry hive, but the extension is .LOG. For example, the transaction log for the SAM hive will be located in `C:\Windows\System32\Config` in the filename SAM.LOG. Sometimes there can be multiple transaction logs as well. In that case, they will have .LOG1, .LOG2 etc., as their extension. It is prudent to look at the transaction logs as well when performing registry forensics.

Registry backups are the opposite of Transaction logs. These are the backups of the registry hives located in the `C:\Windows\System32\Config` directory. These hives are copied to the `C:\Windows\System32\Config\RegBack` directory every ten days. It might be an excellent place to look if you suspect that some registry keys might have been deleted/modified recently.

### 4. Data Acquisition

When performing forensics, we will either encounter a live system or an image taken of the system. For the sake of accuracy, it is recommended practice to image the system or make a copy of the required data and perform forensics on it. This process is called data acquisition. Below we discuss different ways to acquire registry data from a live system or a disk image:

Though we can view the registry through the registry editor, the forensically correct method is to acquire a copy of this data and perform analysis on that. However, when we go to copy the registry hives from `%WINDIR%\System32\Config` , we cannot because it is a restricted file. So, what to do now?

For acquiring these files, we can use one of the following tools:

#### KAPE:

[KAPE](https://www.kroll.com/en/services/cyber-risk/incident-response-litigation-support/kroll-artifact-parser-extractor-kape) is a live data acquisition and analysis tool which can be used to acquire registry data. It is primarily a command-line tool but also comes with a GUI. The below screenshot shows what the KAPE GUI looks like. We have already selected all the settings to extract the registry data using KAPE in this screenshot. We will learn more about collecting forensic artifacts using KAPE in a dedicated KAPE room.

#### Autopsy:

[Autopsy](https://www.autopsy.com/)  gives you the option to acquire data from both live systems or from a disk image. After adding your data source, navigate to the location of the files you want to extract, then right-click and select the Extract File(s) option. It will look similar to what you see in the screenshot below.

![](https://tryhackme-images.s3.amazonaws.com/user-uploads/61306d87a330ed00419e22e7/room-content/5faf350078f7e7e1d1400f46e11e74a9.png)

#### FTK Imager

[FTK Imager](https://www.exterro.com/ftk-imager)  is similar to Autopsy and allows you to extract files from a disk image or a live system by mounting the said disk image or drive in FTK Imager. Below you can see the option to Export files as highlighted in the screenshot.

![](https://tryhackme-images.s3.amazonaws.com/user-uploads/61306d87a330ed00419e22e7/room-content/08b1f97dd47b33c4261fb362d49ac929.png)

Another way you can extract Registry files from FTK Imager is through the Obtain Protected Files option. This option is only available for live systems and is highlighted in the screenshot below. This option allows you to extract all the registry hives to a location of your choosing. However, it will not copy the `Amcache.hve` file, which is often necessary to investigate evidence of programs that were last executed.

![](https://tryhackme-images.s3.amazonaws.com/user-uploads/61306d87a330ed00419e22e7/room-content/6aa5e6825bb003dc803106d5f70e155c.png)

For the purpose of this room, we will not be acquiring data ourselves, but instead, we will work with the attached VM that already has data.
