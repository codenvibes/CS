## 1. Brief

SQL (Structured Query Language) Injection, mostly referred to as SQLi, is an attack on a web application database server that causes malicious queries to be executed. When a web application communicates with a database using input from a user that hasn't been properly validated, there runs the potential of an attacker being able to steal, delete or alter private and customer data and also attack the web application authentication methods to private or customer areas. This is why SQLi is one of the oldest web application vulnerabilities, and it can also be the most damaging.  
  
In this room, you'll learn what databases are, what SQL is with some basic SQL commands, how to detect SQL vulnerabilities, how to exploit SQLi vulnerabilities and, as a developer, how you can protect yourself against SQL Injection.

## 2. What is a Database?

If you're not used to working with databases or exploiting them, there's probably some new terminology to get used to, so let's start with some basics on how databases are structured and how they work.

==A **DEF-database** is an organized collection of structured information, or data, that is stored and managed in a way that makes it easy to access, retrieve, update, and manage. A **database** is like a digital filing cabinet.==
A database is controlled by a DBMS, which is an acronym for  Database Management System. DBMSs fall into two camps: Relational and Non-Relational; the focus of this room will be on Relational databases; some common ones you'll come across are MySQL, Microsoft SQL Server, Access, PostgreSQL and SQLite. We'll explain the difference between Relational and Non-Relational databases at the end of this task, but first, it's important to learn a few terms.

Within a DBMS, you can have multiple databases, each containing its own set of related data. For example, you may have a database called "**shop**". Within this database, you want to store information about products available to **purchase**, **users** who have signed up to your online shop, and information about the **orders** you've received. You'd store this information separately in the database using something called tables. The tables are identified with a unique name for each one. You can see this structure in the diagram below, but you can also see how a business might have other separate databases to store staff information or the accounts team.

### What are tables?

A table is made up of columns and rows; a useful way to imagine a table is like a grid with the columns going across the top from left to right containing the name of the cell and the rows going from top to bottom, with each one having the actual data.

### Columns:

Each column, better referred to as a field, has a unique name per table. When creating a column, you also set the type of data it will contain, common ones being integers (numbers), strings (standard text) or dates. Some databases can contain much more complex data, such as geospatial, which contains location information. Setting the data type also ensures that incorrect information isn't stored, such as the string "hello world" being stored in a column meant for dates. If this happens, the database server will usually produce an error message. A column containing an integer can also have an auto-increment feature enabled; this gives each row of data a unique number that grows (increments) with each subsequent row. Doing so creates what is called a **key** field; a key field has to be unique for every row of data, which can be used to find that exact row in SQL queries.

### Rows:

Rows or records contain individual lines of data. When you add data to the table, a new row/record is created; when you delete data, a row/record is removed.

### Relational Vs Non-Relational Databases:

A relational database stores information in tables, and often, the tables share information between them; they use columns to specify and define the data being stored and rows actually to store the data. The tables will often contain a column that has a unique ID (primary key), which will then be used in other tables to reference it and cause a relationship between the tables, hence the name **relational** database.  

Non-relational databases, sometimes called NoSQL, on the other hand, are any sort of database that doesn't use tables, columns and rows to store the data. A specific database layout doesn't need to be constructed so each row of data can contain different information, giving more flexibility over a relational database.  Some popular databases of this type are MongoDB, Cassandra and ElasticSearch.

Now that you've learned what a database is let's learn how we can actually talk to it using SQL.
