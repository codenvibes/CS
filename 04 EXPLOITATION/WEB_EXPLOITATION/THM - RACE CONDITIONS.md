## 1. Introduction

Let’s say we are tasked with testing the security of an online shopping web application. Many questions pop up. Can we reuse a single $10 gift card to pay for a $100 item? Can we apply the same discount to our shopping cart multiple times? The answer is _maybe_! If the system is susceptible to a race condition vulnerability, we can do all this and more.

==A **DEF-race condition** happens when the behavior of a system depends on the timing or order of events (like thread execution, process scheduling, or signal arrival), and multiple operations attempt to access or modify shared resources at the same time.==

==They’re called **race conditions** because two or more operations are essentially in a _race_ to access or modify a shared resource first.==
- If one process “wins” the race (executes first), the outcome may be correct.
- If another “wins” (executes slightly earlier or later), the outcome may be different or incorrect.
- Since the order isn’t guaranteed and depends on timing, the system’s behavior becomes unpredictable—like the result of a race where the winner changes depending on who crosses the finish line first.

Because the outcome depends on "who gets there first," race conditions often lead to **unpredictable, inconsistent, or incorrect results**.

This room introduces the race conditions vulnerability. A race condition is a situation in computer programs where the timing of events influences the behaviour and outcome of the program. It typically happens when a variable gets accessed and modified by multiple threads. Due to a lack of proper lock mechanisms and synchronization between the different threads, an attacker might abuse the system and apply a discount multiple times or make money transactions beyond their balance.

### Learning Objectives

After completing this room, you will learn about the following:
- Race conditions vulnerability
- Using Burp Suite Repeater to exploit race conditions

Along the way, you will also learn about:
- Threads and multi-threading
- State diagrams
