## 1. Introduction

### What is File inclusion?

This room aims to equip you with the essential knowledge to exploit file inclusion vulnerabilities, including Local File Inclusion (LFI), Remote File Inclusion (RFI), and directory traversal. Also, we will discuss the risk of these vulnerabilities if they're found and the required remediation. We provide some practical examples of each vulnerability as well as hands-on challenges.

In some scenarios, web applications are written to request access to files on a given system, including images, static text, and so on via parameters. Parameters are query parameter strings attached to the URL that could be used to retrieve data or perform actions based on user input. The following diagram breaks down the essential parts of a URL.

For example, parameters are used with Google searching, where GET requests pass user input into the search engine. https://www.google.com/search?q=TryHackMe. If you are not familiar with the topic, you can view the [How The Web Works](https://tryhackme.com/module/how-the-web-works) module to understand the concept.  

Let's discuss a scenario where a user requests to access files from a webserver. First, the user sends an HTTP request to the webserver that includes a file to display. For example, if a user wants to access and display their CV within the web application, the request may look as follows, http://webapp.thm/get.php?file=userCV.pdf, where the file is the parameter and the userCV.pdf, is the required file to access.

### Why do File inclusion vulnerabilities happen?

File inclusion vulnerabilities are commonly found and exploited in various programming languages for web applications, such as PHP that are poorly written and implemented. The main issue of these vulnerabilities is the input validation, in which the user inputs are not sanitized or validated, and the user controls them. When the input is not validated, the user can pass any input to the function, causing the vulnerability.

### What is the risk of File inclusion?

By default, an attacker can leverage file inclusion vulnerabilities to leak data, such as code, credentials or other important files related to the web application or operating system. Moreover, if the attacker can write files to the server by any other means, file inclusion might be used in tandem to gain remote command execution (RCE).

## 3. Path Traversal

Also known as Directory traversal, a web security vulnerability allows an attacker to read operating system resources, such as local files on the server running an application. The attacker exploits this vulnerability by manipulating and abusing the web application's URL to locate and access files or directories stored outside the application's root directory.>

Path traversal vulnerabilities occur when the user's input is passed to a function such as `file_get_contents` in PHP. It's important to note that the function is not the main contributor to the vulnerability. Often poor input validation or filtering is the cause of the vulnerability. In PHP, you can use the `file_get_contents` to read the content of a file. You can find more information about the function [here](https://www.php.net/manual/en/function.file-get-contents.php).

The following graph shows how a web application stores files in `/var/www/app`. The happy path would be the user requesting the contents of userCV.pdf from a defined path `/var/www/app/CVs`.
<div align="center"><br><img src="https://tryhackme-images.s3.amazonaws.com/user-uploads/5d617515c8cd8348d0b4e68f/room-content/45d9c1baacda290c1f95858e27f740c9.png"></div>

We can test out the URL parameter by adding payloads to see how the web application behaves. Path traversal attacks, also known as the **dot-dot-slash attack**, take advantage of moving the directory one step up using the double dots ../. If the attacker finds the entry point, which in this case `get.php?file=`, then the attacker may send something as follows, `http://webapp.thm/get.php?file=../../../../etc/passwd`

Suppose there isn't input validation, and instead of accessing the PDF files at `/var/www/app/CVs` location, the web application retrieves files from other directories, which in this case `/etc/passwd`. Each `..` entry moves one directory until it reaches the root directory `/`. Then it changes the directory to `/etc`, and from there, it read the passwd file.
<div align="center"><br><img src="https://tryhackme-images.s3.amazonaws.com/user-uploads/5d617515c8cd8348d0b4e68f/room-content/3037513935e3242f74bd0fe97833b5ac.png"></div>

As a result, the web application sends back the file's content to the user.
<div align="center"><br><img src="https://tryhackme-images.s3.amazonaws.com/user-uploads/5d617515c8cd8348d0b4e68f/room-content/c12d34456ebe25bafffeb829c58f98c0.png"></div>

Similarly, if the web application runs on a Windows server, the attacker needs to provide Windows paths. For example, if the attacker wants to read the `boot.ini` file located in `c:\boot.ini`, then the attacker can try the following depending on the target OS version:

`http://webapp.thm/get.php?file=../../../../boot.ini` or

`http://webapp.thm/get.php?file=../../../../windows/win.ini`

The same concept applies here as with Linux operating systems, where we climb up directories until it reaches the root directory, which is usually .

Sometimes, developers will add filters to limit access to only certain files or directories. Below are some common OS files you could use when testing.

| **Location**                  | **Description**                                                                                                                                                   |

## 4. Local File Inclusion - LFI

LFI attacks against web applications are often due to a developers' lack of security awareness. With PHP, using functions such as `include`, `require`, `include_once`, and `require_once` often contribute to vulnerable web applications. In this room, we'll be picking on PHP, but it's worth noting LFI vulnerabilities also occur when using other languages such as ASP, JSP, or even in Node.js apps. LFI exploits follow the same concepts as path traversal.

In this section, we will walk you through various LFI scenarios and how to exploit them.

**#1.** Suppose the web application provides two languages, and the user can select between the EN and AR

```php
<?PHP 
	include($_GET["lang"]);
?>
```

The PHP code above uses a `GET` request via the URL parameter `lang` to include the file of the page. The call can be done by sending the following HTTP request as follows: `http://webapp.thm/index.php?lang=EN.php` to load the English page or `http://webapp.thm/index.php?lang=AR.php` to load the Arabic page, where EN.php and AR.php files exist in the same directory.

Theoretically, we can access and display any readable file on the server from the code above if there isn't any input validation. Let's say we want to read the `/etc/passwd` file, which contains sensitive information about the users of the Linux operating system, we can try the following: `http://webapp.thm/get.php?file=/etc/passwd`

In this case, it works because there isn't a directory specified in the include function and no input validation.

Now apply what we discussed and try to read `/etc/passwd` file. Also, answer question #1 below.

**#2.** Next, In the following code, the developer decided to specify the directory inside the function.

```php
<?PHP 
	include("languages/". $_GET['lang']); 
?>
```

In the above code, the developer decided to use the `include` function to call PHP pages in the `languages` directory only via `lang` parameters.

If there is no input validation, the attacker can manipulate the URL by replacing the `lang` input with other OS-sensitive files such as `/etc/passwd`.

Again the payload looks similar to the path traversal, but the `include` function allows us to include any called files into the current page. The following will be the exploit:

http://webapp.thm/index.php?lang=../../../../etc/passwd

Now apply what we discussed, try to read files within the server, and figure out the directory specified in the include function and answer question #2 below.

## 5. Local File Inclusion - LFI Continued

In this task, we go a little bit deeper into LFI. We discussed a couple of techniques to bypass the filter within the include function.

**#3.** In the first two cases, we checked the code for the web app, and then we knew how to exploit it. However, in this case, we are performing black box testing, in which we don't have the source code. In this case, errors are significant in understanding how the data is passed and processed into the web app.

In this scenario, we have the following entry point: `http://webapp.thm/index.php?lang=EN`. If we enter an invalid input, such as THM, we get the following error

```php
Warning: include(languages/THM.php): failed to open stream: No such file or directory in /var/www/html/THM-4/index.php on line 12
```

The error message discloses significant information. By entering THM as input, an error message shows what the include function looks like: `include(languages/THM.php);`.

If you look at the directory closely, we can tell the function includes files in the languages directory is adding .php at the end of the entry. Thus the valid input will be something as follows: `index.php?lang=EN`, where the file EN is located inside the given languages directory and named `EN.php`.

Also, the error message disclosed another important piece of information about the full web application directory path which is `/var/www/html/THM-4/`.

To exploit this, we need to use the `../` trick, as described in the directory traversal section, to get out the current folder. Let's try the following:

`http://webapp.thm/index.php?lang=../../../../etc/passwd`

Note that we used 4 `../` because we know the path has four levels `/var/www/html/THM-4`. But we still receive the following error:

```php
Warning: include(languages/../../../../../etc/passwd.php): failed to open stream: No such file or directory in /var/www/html/THM-4/index.php on line 12
```

It seems we could move out of the PHP directory but still, the include function reads the input with `.php` at the end! This tells us that the developer specifies the file type to pass to the include function. To bypass this scenario, we can use the NULL BYTE, which is `%00`.

Using null bytes is an injection technique where URL-encoded representation such as %00 or 0x00 in hex with user-supplied data to terminate strings. You could think of it as trying to trick the web app into disregarding whatever comes after the Null Byte.

By adding the Null Byte at the end of the payload, we tell the include function to ignore anything after the null byte which may look like:

`include("languages/../../../../../etc/passwd%00").".php");` which is equivalent to `include("languages/../../../../../etc/passwd");`

**Note:** the %00 trick is fixed and not working with PHP 5.3.4 and above.

Now apply what we showed in Lab #3, and try to read files /etc/passwd, answer question #1 below.

**#4.** In this section, the developer decided to filter keywords to avoid disclosing sensitive information! The /etc/passwd file is being filtered. There are two possible methods to bypass the filter. First, by using the NullByte %00 or the current directory trick at the end of the filtered keyword `/..` The exploit will be similar to `http://webapp.thm/index.php?lang=/etc/passwd/`. We could also use `http://webapp.thm/index.php?lang=/etc/passwd%00`.

To make it clearer, if we try this concept in the file system using `cd ..`, it will get you back one step; however, if you do `cd .`, It stays in the current directory. Similarly, if we try `/etc/passwd/..`, it results to be `/etc/` and that's because we moved one to the root. Now if we try `/etc/passwd/.`, the result will be `/etc/passwd` since dot refers to the current directory.

Now apply this technique in Lab #4 and figure out to read /etc/passwd.

**#5.** Next, in the following scenarios, the developer starts to use input validation by filtering some keywords. Let's test out and check the error message!

`http://webapp.thm/index.php?lang=../../../../etc/passwd`

We got the following error!

```php
Warning: include(languages/etc/passwd): failed to open stream: No such file or directory in /var/www/html/THM-5/index.php on line 15
```

If we check the warning message in the `include(languages/etc/passwd)` section, we know that the web application replaces the `../` with the empty string. There are a couple of techniques we can use to bypass this.

First, we can send the following payload to bypass it: `....//....//....//....//....//etc/passwd`.

Why did this work?

This works because the PHP filter only matches and replaces the first subset string `../` it finds and doesn't do another pass, leaving what is pictured below.
<div align="center"><br><img src="https://tryhackme-images.s3.amazonaws.com/user-uploads/5d617515c8cd8348d0b4e68f/room-content/30d3bf0341ba99485c5f683a416a056d.png"></div>

Try out Lab #5 and try to read /etc/passwd and bypass the filter!

**#6.** Finally, we'll discuss the case where the developer forces the include to read from a defined directory! For example, if the web application asks to supply input that has to include a directory such as: `http://webapp.thm/index.php?lang=languages/EN.php` then, to exploit this, we need to include the directory in the payload like so: `?lang=languages/../../../../../etc/passwd`.

Try this out in Lab #6 and figure what the directory that has to be present in the input field is.
