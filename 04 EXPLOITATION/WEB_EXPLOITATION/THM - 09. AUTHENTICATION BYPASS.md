## Username Enumeration

A helpful exercise to complete when trying to find authentication vulnerabilities is creating a list of valid usernames, which we'll use later in other tasks.  

Website error messages are great resources for collating this information to build our list of valid usernames. We have a form to create a new user account if we go to the Acme IT Support website ([http://10.10.201.230/customers/signup](http://10.10.201.230/customers/signup)) signup page.  

If you try entering the username **admin** and fill in the other form fields with fake information, you'll see we get the error **An account with this username already exists**. We can use the existence of this error message to produce a list of valid usernames already signed up on the system by using the ffuf tool below. The ffuf tool uses a list of commonly used usernames to check against for any matches.  

```shell-session
user@tryhackme$ ffuf -w /usr/share/wordlists/SecLists/Usernames/Names/names.txt -X POST -d "username=FUZZ&email=x&password=x&cpassword=x" -H "Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded" -u http://10.10.201.230/customers/signup -mr "username already exists"
```

In the above example, the `-w` argument selects the file's location on the computer that contains the list of usernames that we're going to check exists. The `-X` argument specifies the request method, this will be a GET request by default, but it is a POST request in our example. The `-d` argument specifies the data that we are going to send. In our example, we have the fields username, email, password and cpassword. We've set the value of the username to **FUZZ**. In the ffuf tool, the FUZZ keyword signifies where the contents from our wordlist will be inserted in the request. The `-H` argument is used for adding additional headers to the request. In this instance, we're setting the `Content-Type` so the web server knows we are sending form data. The `-u` argument specifies the URL we are making the request to, and finally, the `-mr` argument is the text on the page we are looking for to validate we've found a valid username.

The ffuf tool and wordlist come pre-installed on the **AttackBox** or can be installed locally by downloading it from [https://github.com/ffuf/ffuf](https://github.com/ffuf/ffuf).  

Create a file called valid_usernames.txt and add the usernames that you found using ffuf; these will be used in Task 3.

## Brute Force

Using the valid_usernames.txt file we generated in the previous task, we can now use this to attempt a brute force attack on the login page ([http://MACHINE_IP/customers/login](http://machine_ip/customers/login)).

**Note: If you created your valid_usernames file by piping the output from ffuf directly you may have difficulty with this task. Clean your data, or copy just the names into a new file.**

A brute force attack is an automated process that tries a list of commonly used passwords against either a single username or, like in our case, a list of usernames.

When running this command, make sure the terminal is in the same directory as the valid_usernames.txt file.

```shell-session
user@tryhackme$ ffuf -w valid_usernames.txt:W1,/usr/share/wordlists/SecLists/Passwords/Common-Credentials/10-million-password-list-top-100.txt:W2 -X POST -d "username=W1&password=W2" -H "Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded" -u http://MACHINE_IP/customers/login -fc 200
```

This ffuf command is a little different to the previous one in Task 2. Previously we used the **FUZZ** keyword to select where in the request the data from the wordlists would be inserted, but because we're using multiple wordlists, we have to specify our own FUZZ keyword. In this instance, we've chosen `W1` for our list of valid usernames and `W2` for the list of passwords we will try. The multiple wordlists are again specified with the `-w` argument but separated with a comma.  For a positive match, we're using the `-fc` argument to check for an HTTP status code other than 200.  

Running the above command will find a single working username and password combination that answers the question below.
