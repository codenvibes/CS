## Task 1. Overpass

What happens when a group of broke Computer Science students try to make a password manager?  
Obviously a _perfect_ commercial success!

There is a TryHackMe subscription code hidden on this box. The first person to find and activate it will get a one month subscription for free! If you're already a subscriber, why not give the code to a friend?

UPDATE: The code is now claimed.  
The machine was slightly modified on 2020/09/25. This was only to improve the performance of the machine. It does not affect the process.
