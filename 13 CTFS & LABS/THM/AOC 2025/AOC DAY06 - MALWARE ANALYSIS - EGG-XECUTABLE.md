## Task 1. Introduction
### The Story

![Task banner for day 6](https://tryhackme-images.s3.amazonaws.com/user-uploads/5de96d9ca744773ea7ef8c00/room-content/5de96d9ca744773ea7ef8c00-1762347310499.svg)

The town of Wareville remains quiet in the middle of the night. While the residents of Wareville are nicely tucked up in bed, blissfully unaware, the SOC team at _The Best Festival Company (TBFC)_ remain alert, poised and ready for whatever may face them.

Monitoring their screens, armed with a freshly poured mug of hot cocoa, the elves of the SOC watch their dashboards diligently. 

Suddenly, the elves receive an email in unison from Elf McClause, Head of Elf Affairs, in their inboxes. It reads:

**From:** Elf McClause
**Subject:** A new schedule awaits
**Attachments:** HopHelper.exe

To all Elves, going forward, we will be using a new program for creating and viewing team rotas. 

This new program will revolutionalise how rotas are made here at The Best Festival Company.

Please contact IT support if you have issues running the program.

Kind regards, remain the best,

Elf McClause

Head of Elf Affairs

_"Why is Elf McClause working at 3AM?"_ Screams a member of the SOC team in the background. They're right, something is amiss.

Elf McBlue is immediately suspicious. Their years of experience in the SOC have given them the wisdom not to download "out of the blue" executables. Without McSkidy's wisdom, Elf McBlue takes charge, loading up their malware investigation toolkik - the investigation begins.

## Learning Objectives

Today's room will have you taking the place of Elf McBlue, a highly talented member of The Best Festival Company's malware investigation squad. You have been tasked with investigating a highly suspicious executable that is being shared within the company. In today's room, we will be covering the following:

- The principles of malware analysis
- An introduction to sandboxes
- Static vs. dynamic analysis
- Tools of the trade: PeStudio, ProcMon, Regshot

## Connecting to the Machine

Before moving forward, review the questions in the connection card shown below:

Start your target machine by clicking the **Start Machine** button below. The machine will open in split view and need about 2 minutes to fully boot. In case you can not see it, click the **Show Split View** button at the top of the page.

### Set up your virtual environment

To successfully complete this room, you'll need to set up your virtual environment. This involves starting the Target Machine, ensuring you're equipped with the necessary tools and access to tackle the challenges ahead.
