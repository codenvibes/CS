## Task 1. Introduction
### The Story

![task banner for day 4. Showing a wreath, with baubles hanging with various AI and cyber security related iconography](https://tryhackme-images.s3.amazonaws.com/user-uploads/5de96d9ca744773ea7ef8c00/room-content/5de96d9ca744773ea7ef8c00-1763383093538.png)

The lights glimmer and servers hum blissfully at The Best Festival Company (TBFC), melting the snow surrounding the data centre. TBFC has continued its pursuit of AI excellence. After the past two years, they realise that Van Chatty, their in-house chatbot, wasn’t quite meeting their standards. 

Unfortunately for the elves at TBFC, they are also not immune to performance metrics. The elves aim to find ways of increasing their velocity; something to manage the tedious, distracting tasks, which allows the elves to do the real magic. 

TBFC, adventurous as ever, is trialling their brand new cyber security AI assistant, Van SolveIT, which is capable of helping the elves with all their defensive, offensive, and software needs. They decide to put this flashy technology to use as Christmas approaches, to identify, confirm, and resolve any potential vulnerabilities, before any nay-sayers can.
