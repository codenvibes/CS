## Task 1. Introduction

### The Story

![Task banner for day 1](https://tryhackme-images.s3.amazonaws.com/user-uploads/6228f0d4ca8e57005149c3e3/room-content/6228f0d4ca8e57005149c3e3-1763378686706.png)

The unthinkable has happened - McSkidy has been kidnapped. Without her, Wareville’s defenses are faltering, and Christmas itself hangs by a thread. But panic won’t save the season. A long road lies ahead to uncover what truly happened. The TBFC (The Best Festival Company) team already brainstorms what to do next, and their first lead points to the **tbfc-web01**, a Linux server processing Christmas wishlists. Somewhere within its data may lie the truth: traces of McSkidy’s final actions, or perhaps the clues to King Malhare’s twisted vision for EASTMAS.

### Connecting to the Machine

Before moving forward, review the questions in the connection card shown below:

![Connection Card](https://tryhackme-images.s3.amazonaws.com/user-uploads/6228f0d4ca8e57005149c3e3/room-content/6228f0d4ca8e57005149c3e3-1763378922643.png)

Start the lab by clicking the **Start Machine** button below. The machine will start in split view and will take about two minutes to load. In case the machine is not visible, click the **Show Split View** button at the top of the page. Once the machine is loaded, you will have a terminal window - that's your Linux CLI, you'll need to type the commands there!
