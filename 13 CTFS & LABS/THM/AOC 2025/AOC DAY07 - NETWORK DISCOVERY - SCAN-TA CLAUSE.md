## Task 1. Introduction
### The Story

![Task banner for day 7](https://tryhackme-images.s3.amazonaws.com/user-uploads/678ecc92c80aa206339f0f23/room-content/678ecc92c80aa206339f0f23-1763378850592.png)

Christmas preparations are delayed - HopSec has breached our QA environment and locked us out! Without it, the TBFC projects can't be tested, and our entire SOC-mas pipeline is frozen. To make things worse, the server is slowly transforming into a twisted EAST-mas node.

Can you uncover HopSec's trail, find a way back into **tbfc-devqa01**, and restore the server before the bunny's takeover is complete? For this task, you'll need to check every place to hide, every opened port that bunnies left unprotected. Good luck!

Start your target machine by clicking the **Start Machine** button below. The machine will need about 2 minutes to fully boot. Additionally, start your AttackBox by clicking the **Start AttackBox** button below. The AttackBox will start in split view. In case you can not see it, click the **Show Split View** button at the top of the page.

#### Set up your virtual environment

To successfully complete this room, you'll need to set up your virtual environment. This involves starting both your AttackBox (if you're not using your VPN) and Target Machines, ensuring you're equipped with the necessary tools and access to tackle the challenges ahead.
