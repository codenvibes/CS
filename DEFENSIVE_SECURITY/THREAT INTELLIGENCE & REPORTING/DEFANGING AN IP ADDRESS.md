**Defanging an IP address** means modifying it in a way that prevents it from being automatically clickable or interpreted as a link—**without breaking its readability** for humans.

This is mainly done to **prevent accidental access**, especially when sharing malicious IPs or URLs in emails, logs, or reports (like in cybersecurity). The goal is to **avoid triggering firewalls, antivirus software, or a user’s browser**.

## Example:

Original IP:

```
192.168.0.1
```

Defanged IP:

```
192[.]168[.]0[.]1
```

Sometimes it may also be written as:

```
192.168.0[.]1
```

or

```
192(.)168(.)0(.)1
```

## Use Cases:

- Cybersecurity reports
- Malware analysis writeups
- Threat intelligence sharing
- Avoiding automatic hyperlinking in emails or chat
