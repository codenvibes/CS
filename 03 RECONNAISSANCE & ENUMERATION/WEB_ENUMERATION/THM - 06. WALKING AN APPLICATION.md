#THM_JR_PENETRATION_TESTER #INTRODUCTION_TO_WEB_HACKING

Manually review a web application for security issues using only your browsers developer tools. Hacking with just your browser, no tools or scripts.

Here is a short breakdown of the in-built browser tools you will use:
- **View Source** - Use your browser to view the human-readable source code of a website.
- **Inspector** - Learn how to inspect page elements and make changes to view usually blocked content.
- **Debugger** - Inspect and control the flow of a page's JavaScript
- **Network** - See all the network requests a page makes.

## Developer Tools - Inspector

Every modern browser includes developer tools; this is a tool kit used to aid web developers in debugging web applications and gives you a peek under the hood of a website to see what is going on. As a pentester, we can leverage these tools to provide us with a much better understanding of the web application. We're specifically focusing on three features of the developer tool kit, Inspector, Debugger and Network.

### Opening Developer Tools

The way to access developer tools is different for every browser.  

### Inspector

The page source doesn't always represent what's shown on a webpage; this is because CSS, JavaScript and user interaction can change the content and style of the page, which means we need a way to view what's been displayed in the browser window at this exact time. Element inspector assists us with this by providing us with a live representation of what is currently on the website.

As well as viewing this live view, we can also edit and interact with the page elements, which is helpful for web developers to debug issues.
On the Acme IT Support website, click into the news section, where you'll see three news articles.

The first two articles are readable, but the third has been blocked with a floating notice above the content stating you have to be a premium customer to view the article. These floating boxes blocking the page contents are often referred to as paywalls as they put up a metaphorical wall in front of the content you wish to see until you pay.

Right-clicking on the premium notice ( paywall ), you should be able to select the Inspect option from the menu, which opens the developer tools either on the bottom or right-hand side depending on your browser or preferences. You'll now see the elements/HTML that make up the website ( similar to the screenshots below ).

Locate the `DIV` element with the class `premium-customer-blocker` and click on it. You'll see all the CSS styles in the styles box that apply to this element, such as `margin-top: 60px` and `text-align: center`. The style we're interested in is the `display: block`. If you click on the word `block`, you can type a value of your own choice. Try typing `none`, and this will make the box disappear, revealing the content underneath it and a flag. If the element didn't have a display field, you could click below the last style and add in your own. Have a play with the element inspector, and you'll see you can change any of the information on the website, including the content. Remember this is only edited on your browser window, and when you press refresh, everything will be back to normal.

## Developer Tools - Debugger

This panel in the developer tools is intended for debugging JavaScript, and again is an excellent feature for web developers wanting to work out why something might not be working. But as penetration testers, it gives us the option of digging deep into the JavaScript code. In Firefox and Safari, this feature is called Debugger, but in Google Chrome, it's called Sources.

On the Acme IT Support website, click on the contact page, each time the page is loaded, you might notice a rapid flash of red on the screen. We're going to use the Debugger to work out what this red flash is and if it contains anything interesting. Debugging a red dot wouldn't be something you'd do in the real world as a penetration tester, but it does allow us to use this feature and get used to the Debugger.

In both browsers, on the left-hand side, you see a list of all the resources the current webpage is using. If you click into the assets folder, you'll see a file named flash.min.js. Clicking on this file displays the contents of the JavaScript file.

Many times when viewing javascript files, you'll notice that everything is on one line, which is because it has been minimised, which means all formatting ( tabs, spacing and newlines ) have been removed to make the file smaller. This file is no exception to this, and it has also been obfusticated, which makes it purposely difficult to read, so it can't be copied as easily by other developers.

We can return some of the formattings by using the "Pretty Print" option, which looks like two braces { } to make it a little more readable, although due to the obfustication, it's still difficult to comprehend what is going on with the file. If you scroll to the bottom of the flash.min.js file, you'll see the line: `flash['remove']();`

This little bit of JavaScript is what is removing the red popup from the page. We can utilise another feature of debugger called **breakpoints**. These are points in the code that we can force the browser to stop processing the JavaScript and pause the current execution.

If you click the line number that contains the above code, you'll notice it turns blue; you've now inserted a breakpoint on this line. Now try refreshing the page, and you'll notice the red box stays on the page instead of disappearing, and it contains a flag.

## Developer Tools - Network  

The network tab on the developer tools can be used to keep track of every external request a webpage makes. If you click on the Network tab and then refresh the page, you'll see all the files the page is requesting. 
 
Try doing this on the contact page; you can press the trash can icon to delete the list if it gets a bit overpopulated.
 
With the network tab open, try filling in the contact form and pressing the **Send Message** button. You'll notice an event in the network tab, and this is the form being submitted in the background using a method called AJAX. AJAX is a method for sending and receiving network data in a web application background without interfering by changing the current web page.

Examine the new entry on the network tab that the contact form created and view the page the data was sent to in order to reveal a flag.
