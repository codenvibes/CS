The **Wayback Machine** is an incredibly useful tool for exploring the history of websites — it’s basically an internet time machine!

- It is a digital archive of the World Wide Web, run by the **Internet Archive** (a non-profit).
- URL: https://archive.org/web/
- It lets you **view snapshots of websites as they looked at different points in time** — sometimes going back to the 1990s.
