### ⚠️ Legal & Ethical Note

Anonymity is a **right**, but how it's used matters. Courses are legal when used for:

- Whistleblowing
    
- Avoiding oppressive surveillance
    
- Cybersecurity research
    
- General privacy
    

Avoid applying techniques to commit crimes or violate terms of service — that crosses into illegal territory.
