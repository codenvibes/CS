- Test with tools like **FoxProxy** (Firefox) or **Proxychains** (Linux).
    
- Learn to differentiate:
    
    - **Datacenter proxies** (fast, cheap, less anonymous)
        
    - **Residential proxies** (more believable IPs, more expensive)
        
    - **SOCKS5 proxies** (better for anonymity, e.g., from Tor)
