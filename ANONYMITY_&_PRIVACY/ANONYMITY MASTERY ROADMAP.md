# LEVEL 1: Privacy Foundations

**Goal**: Minimize your current exposure and lay the groundwork for privacy hygiene.

#### 🔹 Actions

    - DuckDuckGo or Startpage
        
- Create a **burner email** using ProtonMail or Tutanota.
    
- Audit and delete old or unused online accounts ([JustDelete.me](https://justdelete.me/)).
    

#### 🔹 Tools

- Browser: Brave or Firefox (with telemetry off)
    
- Email: ProtonMail / Tutanota

### ✅ **LEVEL 2: Basic Anonymity Layer (Week 3–4)**

**Goal**: Start separating your real identity from online activities.

#### 🔹 Actions

- Start using **VPNs** with a no-logs policy (e.g., Mullvad, ProtonVPN).
    
- Create separate **pseudonymous personas** for different purposes (social, research, etc.).
    
- Practice **compartmentalization**: Never mix identities or devices.
    
- Use **temporary/burner phone numbers** for signups (e.g., TextNow, MySudo).
    
- Learn to use **Incognito/Private Browsing** correctly (and its limitations).
- Use **HTTP/SOCKS5 proxies** to route specific apps or browser traffic.
    
- Test with tools like **FoxProxy** (Firefox) or **Proxychains** (Linux).
    
- Learn to differentiate:
    
    - **Datacenter proxies** (fast, cheap, less anonymous)
        
    - **Residential proxies** (more believable IPs, more expensive)
        
    - **SOCKS5 proxies** (better for anonymity, e.g., from Tor)

#### 🔹 Tools

- VPN: Mullvad, ProtonVPN (not free ones)
    
- Burner phones or SIM cards (optional)
    

#### 🔹 Learn

- How IP addresses reveal your location
    
- Why a VPN alone is **not** anonymity
    
- Threat modeling basics: _who do you want to hide from?_

### ✅ **LEVEL 3: Anonymous Internet Use (Month 2)**

**Goal**: Begin browsing, communicating, and transacting anonymously.

#### 🔹 Actions

- Use **Tor Browser** for sensitive browsing (from a non-personal OS).
    
- Boot from **Tails OS** (runs entirely from USB, leaves no traces).
    
- Communicate using **Signal**, Session, or Ricochet (anonymous chat).
    
- Use **crypto wallets** with privacy coins (e.g., Monero, Zcash).
    

#### 🔹 Tools

- Tor Browser (download from [torproject.org](https://www.torproject.org/))
    
- Tails OS (burn to USB)
    
- Signal / Session
    
- Monero wallet (Feather Wallet)
    

#### 🔹 Learn

- Onion routing & how Tor works
    
- Cryptocurrency privacy vs. pseudonymity
    
- What DNS leaks are and how to prevent them
    

---

### ✅ **LEVEL 4: Advanced Anonymity (Month 3)**

**Goal**: Combine tools, isolate environments, and eliminate traceable patterns.

#### 🔹 Actions

- Use **Whonix** or **Qubes OS** for hardened, compartmentalized systems.
    
- Randomize or spoof your **browser fingerprint** (with caution).
    
- Chain **VPN → Tor → Internet** for extra layers.
    
- Use **MAC address randomization** on devices before connecting to networks.
    
- Never reuse usernames or emails across platforms.
    

#### 🔹 Tools

- Whonix (ideal for anonymity with virtual machines)
    
- Qubes OS (for advanced users)
    
- MAC address changer (Linux: `macchanger`, Windows: TMAC)
    

#### 🔹 Learn

- Virtual machines & sandboxing
    
- OPSEC: hiding in plain sight
    
- Secure file sharing (OnionShare, Magic Wormhole)
    

---

### ✅ **LEVEL 5: Expert OpSec & Real-World Anonymity (Month 4+)**

**Goal**: Master anonymity in real life and online. Be untraceable unless you _choose_ not to be.

#### 🔹 Actions

- Never connect your real identity to your anonymous one (digitally or physically).
    
- Practice **air-gapped** system use for highly sensitive activities.
    
- Transact with cash or privacy coins only.
    
- Study **de-anonymization** techniques to understand how people get exposed.
    

#### 🔹 Tools

- Air-gapped laptop for ultra-private tasks
    
- Electromagnetic shielding for RF-sensitive areas
    
- Disposable travel routers or 4G dongles with prepaid SIMs
    

#### 🔹 Learn

- How facial recognition, gait analysis, and other bio-data work
    
- Counter-forensics and metadata stripping (e.g., `exiftool`)
    
- How intelligence agencies conduct surveillance
