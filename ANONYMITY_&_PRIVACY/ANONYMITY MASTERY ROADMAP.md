## LEVEL 1: Privacy Foundations

**Goal**: Minimize your current exposure and lay the groundwork for privacy hygiene.

### Actions

- Use a **privacy-first browser**: Firefox (hardened) or Brave.
- Install key **privacy extensions**:
    - uBlock Origin
    - Privacy Badger
    - HTTPS Everywhere (or use Brave’s built-in)
- Switch to **privacy-respecting search engines**:
    - DuckDuckGo or Startpage
- Create a **burner email** using ProtonMail or Tutanota.
- Audit and delete old or unused online accounts ([JustDelete.me](https://justdelete.me/)).

####  Tools

- Browser: Brave or Firefox (with telemetry of
- Email: ProtonMail / Tutano
- Password Manager: Bitwarden or KeePass

####  Learn

- What is metadata and why it matters
- How trackers and cookies work
- How websites fingerprint you

## LEVEL 2: Basic Anonymity Layer

**Goal**: Start separating your real identity from online activities.

####  Actions

- Start using **VPNs** with a no-logs policy (e.g., Mullvad, ProtonVPN).
- Create separate **pseudonymous personas** for different purposes (social, research, etc.).
- Practice **compartmentalization**: Never mix identities or devices.
- Use **temporary/burner phone numbers** for signups (e.g., TextNow, MySudo).
- Learn to use **Incognito/Private Browsing** correctly (and its limitations).
- Use **HTTP/SOCKS5 proxies** to route specific apps or browser traffic.
- Test with tools like **FoxProxy** (Firefox) or **Proxychains** (Linux).
- Learn to differentiate:
    - **Datacenter proxies** (fast, cheap, less anonymous
    - **Residential proxies** (more believable IPs, more expensive
    - **SOCKS5 proxies** (better for anonymity, e.g., from Tor)

####  Tools

- VPN: Mullvad, ProtonVPN (not free ones)
- Burner phones or SIM cards (optional)

####  Learn

- How IP addresses reveal your location
- Why a VPN alone is **not** anonymity
- Threat modeling basics: _who do you want to hide from?_

---

## LEVEL 3: Anonymous Internet Use

**Goal**: Begin browsing, communicating, and transacting anonymously.

####  Actions

- Use **Tor Browser** for sensitive browsing (from a non-personal OS).
- Boot from **Tails OS** (runs entirely from USB, leaves no traces).
- Communicate using **Signal**, Session, or Ricochet (anonymous chat).
- Use **crypto wallets** with privacy coins (e.g., Monero, Zcash).

####  Tools

- Tor Browser (download from [torproject.org](https://www.torproject.org/))
- Tails OS (burn to USB)
- Signal / Session
- Monero wallet (Feather Wallet)

####  Learn

- Onion routing & how Tor works
- Cryptocurrency privacy vs. pseudonymity
- What DNS leaks are and how to prevent them

---

## LEVEL 4: Advanced Anonymity

**Goal**: Combine tools, isolate environments, and eliminate traceable patterns.

####  Actions

- Use **Whonix** or **Qubes OS** for hardened, compartmentalized systems.
- Randomize or spoof your **browser fingerprint** (with caution).
- Chain **VPN → Tor → Internet** for extra layers.
- Use **MAC address randomization** on devices before connecting to networks.
- Never reuse usernames or emails across platforms.

####  Tools

- Whonix (ideal for anonymity with virtual machines)
- Qubes OS (for advanced users)
- MAC address changer (Linux: `macchanger`, Windows: TMAC)

####  Learn

- Virtual machines & sandboxing
- OPSEC: hiding in plain sight
- Secure file sharing (OnionShare, Magic Wormhole)

---

## LEVEL 5: Expert OpSec & Real-World Anonymity

**Goal**: Master anonymity in real life and online. Be untraceable unless you _choose_ not to be.

####  Actions

- Never connect your real identity to your anonymous one (digitally or physically).
- Practice **air-gapped** system use for highly sensitive activities.
- Transact with cash or privacy coins only.
- Study **de-anonymization** techniques to understand how people get exposed.

####  Tools

- Air-gapped laptop for ultra-private tasks
- Electromagnetic shielding for RF-sensitive areas
- Disposable travel routers or 4G dongles with prepaid SIMs

####  Learn

- How facial recognition, gait analysis, and other bio-data work
- Counter-forensics and metadata stripping (e.g., `exiftool`)
- How intelligence agencies conduct surveillance
