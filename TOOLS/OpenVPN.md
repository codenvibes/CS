## What is OpenVPN?

OpenVPN is an open-source Virtual Private Network (VPN) solution that uses custom security protocols to create secure point-to-point or site-to-site connections.

It allows:

- Secure remote access to networks
    
- Encrypted tunnels for traffic
    
- Safe connections on public Wi-Fi
    
- Connecting virtual labs (e.g., TryHackMe or Hack The Box)

### 🧱 Key Components

- **Client Config (`.ovpn`) file**: Contains settings, keys, and server info.
    
- **Server**: Remote machine you're connecting to.
    
- **Client**: Your local machine.

### 📦 Common Files in OpenVPN Setup

- `.ovpn` file: Config file to connect to VPN
    
- `ca.crt`: Certificate authority file (validates server cert)
    
- `client.crt`: Your client certificate
    
- `client.key`: Your private key
    
- `ta.key`: TLS auth key (for additional security, optional)

### 🔧 How to Connect Using OpenVPN (Linux)

1. **Install OpenVPN**
    
    ```bash
    sudo apt update
    sudo apt install openvpn
    ```
    
2. **Navigate to the `.ovpn` file**
    
    ```bash
    cd ~/Downloads
    ```
    
3. **Connect**
    
    ```bash
    sudo openvpn <filename>.ovpn
    ```
    
4. **Verify connection**
    
    - Check your IP
        
    - Use `ifconfig` or `ip a` to view tunnel interface (usually `tun0`)

### 🧠 Common Issues

- `.ovpn` file missing
    
- No sudo privileges
    
- DNS leaks (use secure DNS or manually configure)
    

---

### 🔐 Security Tips

- Don’t share your `.ovpn` file
    
- Rotate keys periodically
    
- Avoid storing VPN credentials in plaintext

### ✅ Use Cases in Cybersecurity Labs

- **TryHackMe/HTB**: Both use OpenVPN to connect your system to their virtual lab networks
    
- **Simulated Attacks**: Secure your machine while attacking or pentesting remote VMs

## 📂 Where to Put These Notes in Your Structure

This fits under:

### 🛠️ Core Concepts → **Virtualization & VMs**

- Because it's foundational for connecting to lab environments
    

AND

### 🔍 Reconnaissance & Enumeration → **Lab Setup Tools** (optional sub-section)

- Since VPN is a prerequisite for scanning and attacking target machines in THM/HTB labs
    

If we want to be even more specific, we could create a section:

---

### 🌐 Network Tunneling & VPNs (Optional New Section)

- OpenVPN
    
- WireGuard
    
- SSH Tunnels
    
- VPN Security Best Practices

Would you like to add that new section or keep it under “Virtualization & VMs”?
