**Impacket** is a popular open-source collection of Python classes focused on working with network protocols. It's widely used by cybersecurity professionals for **penetration testing**, **network reconnaissance**, **credential dumping**, and **lateral movement** in Windows environments.

## Key Features of Impacket:

1. **Low-level protocol interaction:**
    - Provides access to raw packets and lets you craft custom network protocol messages.
    - Supports many protocols: **SMB, NTLM, DNS, RDP, LDAP, Kerberos, MSRPC**, and more.
    
2. **High-level scripting:**
    - Comes with a set of **ready-to-use tools** for common offensive security tasks.
        
3. **Python-based:**
    - Written in Python, making it easily modifiable and scriptable.


### 🛠️ **Common Impacket Tools:**

Some useful tools included in Impacket (located in the `examples/` directory):

|Tool|Description|
|---|---|
|`smbclient.py`|SMB command-line client (like `smbclient` in Linux).|
|`secretsdump.py`|Dumps NTLM hashes and secrets from remote Windows systems.|
|`wmiexec.py`|Executes commands on a remote host using WMI.|
|`psexec.py`|Runs commands remotely using the SMB protocol (like Sysinternals PsExec).|
|`mimikatz.py`|Wrapper for invoking Mimikatz remotely.|
|`ticketer.py`|Creates Kerberos tickets for impersonation (Golden/Silver tickets).|
|`ntlmrelayx.py`|Relays NTLM authentication to hijack sessions and authenticate to services.|

### Use Cases:

- **Red teaming / offensive security:**
    - Credential theft, lateral movement, remote code execution.
- **Blue teaming / defense:**
    - Emulating attacker behavior for detection testing.
- **Protocol testing:**
    - Debug or reverse engineer Windows protocols.

## 1. Installing Impacket

### Requirements:

- **Python 3.7+**

### Installation:

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/fortra/impacket.git
cd impacket

# Install dependencies and setup
pip install -r requirements.txt
python3 setup.py install
```

> ✅ Tip: Run commands with `python3` or add Impacket to your system PATH.

---

## 🧰 2. **Basic Tools and Examples**

Impacket comes with many tools located in the `examples/` directory.

### 🔹 `smbclient.py` – SMB File Access

```bash
python3 examples/smbclient.py user:pass@target_ip
```

Like a Windows share browser. Use it to list and interact with SMB shares.

---

### 🔹 `secretsdump.py` – Dump Password Hashes

```bash
python3 examples/secretsdump.py user:pass@target_ip
```

Extracts:

- NTLM hashes
    
- Cached credentials
    
- LSA secrets
    

---

### 🔹 `psexec.py` – Remote Code Execution via SMB

```bash
python3 examples/psexec.py user:pass@target_ip
```

Launches a shell on the remote system, mimicking Sysinternals PsExec.

---

### 🔹 `wmiexec.py` – Command Execution via WMI

```bash
python3 examples/wmiexec.py user:pass@target_ip
```

Executes commands without writing to disk (fileless execution).

---

### 🔹 `ntlmrelayx.py` – NTLM Relay Attacks

Used in **man-in-the-middle attacks** when capturing and relaying NTLM authentication.

```bash
python3 examples/ntlmrelayx.py -tf targets.txt
```

---

## 📚 3. **Authentication Formats**

Impacket accepts many formats for credentials:

|Format|Example|
|---|---|
|Username & Password|`domain/user:password@target`|
|NTLM Hash|`domain/user@target -hashes :<NTLM_HASH>`|
|Kerberos Ticket|`-k -no-pass` (uses TGT from system)|

---

## 🛡️ 4. **Use Case Scenarios**

|Goal|Tool|
|---|---|
|Browse SMB shares|`smbclient.py`|
|Dump user credentials|`secretsdump.py`|
|Remote command exec|`psexec.py` / `wmiexec.py`|
|Relay NTLM auth|`ntlmrelayx.py`|
|Create forged tickets|`ticketer.py`|

---

## ✅ 5. **Best Practices**

- Use **VPN or lab environments** for testing.
    
- Pair with tools like **CrackMapExec**, **Responder**, and **BloodHound**.
    
- Consider setting up a **Windows test lab** with AD for hands-on learning.
