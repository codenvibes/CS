**Impacket** is a popular open-source collection of Python classes focused on working with network protocols. It's widely used by cybersecurity professionals for **penetration testing**, **network reconnaissance**, **credential dumping**, and **lateral movement** in Windows environments.

### üîç **Key Features of Impacket:**

1. **Low-level protocol interaction:**
    
    - Provides access to raw packets and lets you craft custom network protocol messages.
        
    - Supports many protocols: **SMB, NTLM, DNS, RDP, LDAP, Kerberos, MSRPC**, and more.
        
2. **High-level scripting:**
    
    - Comes with a set of **ready-to-use tools** for common offensive security tasks.
        
3. **Python-based:**
    
    - Written in Python, making it easily modifiable and scriptable.
