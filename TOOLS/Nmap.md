**Nmap** (short for **Network Mapper**) is an open-source tool used for **network discovery** and **security auditing**. It‚Äôs widely used by system administrators, network engineers, and cybersecurity professionals to:

- **Scan networks** to see which devices are connected.
- **Detect open ports** on a system.
- **Identify services** running on those ports (e.g., web servers, SSH).
- **Guess the operating system** of a host (OS fingerprinting).
- **Audit network security** by detecting vulnerabilities.


## How It Works

Nmap sends specially crafted packets to target hosts and analyzes the responses. Based on these, it determines:
- Host availability (is the host online?).
- What ports are open.
- What services/versions are running.
- Operating system and hardware characteristics.

## Common Command Examples

**Scan a single IP**:
    
    ```
    nmap 192.168.1.1
    ```
    
**Scan a range of IPs**:
    
    ```
    nmap 192.168.1.1-50
    ```
    
**Scan a subnet**:
    
    ```
    nmap 192.168.1.0/24
    ```
    
**Service version detection**:
    
    ```
    nmap -sV 192.168.1.1
    ```
    
**OS detection**:
    
    ```
    nmap -O 192.168.1.1
    ```
    
**Aggressive scan (includes version detection, OS detection, script scanning, traceroute)**:
    
    ```
    nmap -A 192.168.1.1
    ```

### üõ†Ô∏è Advanced Features

- **NSE (Nmap Scripting Engine)**: Automates tasks like brute-force attacks, vulnerability detection, or backdoor detection.
    
- **Zenmap**: GUI version of Nmap for easier use.

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Legal Note

Using Nmap on networks you don‚Äôt own or have explicit permission to scan **can be illegal** and is considered unethical.

Would you like help installing it or using it for a specific purpose?
