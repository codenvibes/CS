#### Lab Assignment Guidelines

Log into the Learn on Demand Portal [https://msle.learnondemand.net/](https://msle.learnondemand.net/) with the **Skillable Account** that you created during the class demonstration. 

This week, we will be completing the lab that explores the **Role Based Access Control.** 

#### Submission Instructions:

Create a completion report with a cover page that captures your name and program details. Create a section for each of the labs that should be completed. As you complete each lab, provide evidence of completion by capturing screenshots of your task completions. Ensure your write-ups and screenshots demonstrate enough detail to confirm your engagement in completing the lab as shown below.
