## Google Cloud Account Registration

Instructions:

Go to the link [https://cloud.google.com/](https://cloud.google.com/) to register a free Google Cloud account.

The free account will give you:

- 90-day, $300 Free Trial: New Google Cloud and Google Maps Platform users can take advantage of a 90-day trial period that includes $300 in free Cloud Billing credits to explore and evaluate Google Cloud and Google Maps Platform products and services. You can use these credits toward one or a combination of products.

- Limited time T2A Free Trial: During your Free Trial period, when you use resources covered by the Free Tier, the Free Tier usage is not charged against your Free Trial credits.

- Free Tier: All Google Cloud customers can use select Google Cloud products—like Compute Engine, Cloud Storage, and BigQuery—free of charge, within specified monthly usage limits. When you stay within the Free Tier limits, these resources are not charged against your Free Trial credits or to your Cloud Billing account's payment method after your trial ends.

### Steps to follow:

1. Create a Google/Gmail account or use an existing Google email account.

2. Registration Confirmation: Once you have completed these step, your account registration will be processed and you can access the services immediately.

3. Log in to Google Cloud console [https://console.cloud.google.com/](https://console.cloud.google.com/) using the email address and password you used in registration.

4. To complete your Free Trial signup, you must provide a credit card or other payment method to set up a Cloud Billing account and verify your identity. Don't worry, setting up a Cloud Billing account does not enable Google to charge you. You are not charged unless you explicitly enable billing by upgrading your Cloud Billing account to a paid account. You can upgrade to a paid account at any time during the trial. After you have upgraded, you can still use any remaining credits (within the 90-day period).

5. Confirm your operational account by looking for the Free trial status banner at the top of the page.

6. **Provide evidence (upload as PDF)** showing your operational account capturing a screen shot of your free trial subscription working.

NOTE: **Be careful to monitor costs because you will be billed after the free trial period**
