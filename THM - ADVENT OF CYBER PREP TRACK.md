For the prize raffle terms and conditions, please visit [this page](https://help.tryhackme.com/en/articles/8537472-advent-of-cyber-2025-terms-and-condition#h_cf456f7960).

Please note: Cheating is NOT allowed and will result in a disqualification from the Advent of Cyber event. All winners **will** be fully verified. This includes, in particular:

- creating puppet accounts to inflate your chance to win
- using bots to auto-complete the answers in the room

### How To Qualify

To qualify for the main prizes, you must complete the rooms in the Advent of Cyber 2025 event, starting with Day 1. Only room completions in the Advent of Cyber 2025 roadmap will qualify you for the raffle.

- It doesn't matter when you complete rooms. You just need to complete them by 31st December 2025. For example, if you complete Day 1 on 31st December 2025, you will still receive the same amount of raffle tickets as a user who completes on the day of the task release!
- You don't have to complete all the rooms or complete them in order. The more rooms you complete, the more raffle tickets you get and the higher your chances of winning.

### Certificate

Finally, if you complete every room in the event, you will earn a certificate of completion! As your name will be included on the certificate, we advise ensuring your full name is set (and updated) in [your profile](https://tryhackme.com/manage-account/account-details).
