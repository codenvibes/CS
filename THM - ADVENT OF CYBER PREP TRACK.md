### General Rules

Breaking any of the following rules will result in elimination from the event:

- .tryhackme.com and the OpenVPN server are off-limits to probing, scanning, or exploiting
- Users are only authorised to hack machines deployed in the rooms they have access to
- Users are not to target or attack other users
- Users should only enter the event once, using one account
- Regular AoC Days: Do not share questions, but permissible to show in videos or streams
- Side quests: Do not share questions, or hints, including not sharing it in videos or streams
- Cheating
- Usage of bot accounts

For the prize raffle terms and conditions, please visit [this page](https://help.tryhackme.com/en/articles/8537472-advent-of-cyber-2025-terms-and-condition#h_cf456f7960).

Please note: Cheating is NOT allowed and will result in a disqualification from the Advent of Cyber event. All winners **will** be fully verified. This includes, in particular:

- creating puppet accounts to inflate your chance to win
- using bots to auto-complete the answers in the room
<div align="center">
<br>
<br>
</div>

### How To Qualify

To qualify for the main prizes, you must complete the rooms in the Advent of Cyber 2025 event, starting with Day 1. Only room completions in the Advent of Cyber 2025 roadmap will qualify you for the raffle.

- It doesn't matter when you complete rooms. You just need to complete them by 31st December 2025. For example, if you complete Day 1 on 31st December 2025, you will still receive the same amount of raffle tickets as a user who completes on the day of the task release!
- You don't have to complete all the rooms or complete them in order. The more rooms you complete, the more raffle tickets you get and the higher your chances of winning.

## Task 2. How to use TryHackMe

### A short TryHackMe tutorial

New tasks are released daily at 4pm GMT, with the first challenge being released on 1st December all aimed at beginners. Each task in the event will include instructions on how to interact with the practical material. Please follow them carefully! The instructions will include a connection card similar to the one shown below:

![connection card](https://tryhackme-images.s3.amazonaws.com/user-uploads/6228f0d4ca8e57005149c3e3/room-content/6228f0d4ca8e57005149c3e3-1763550621401.png)

Let's work our way through the different options.

**If the AttackBox option is available:**

TryHackMe's AttackBox is **an Ubuntu Virtual Machine hosted in the cloud**. Think of the AttackBox as your virtual computer, which you would use to conduct a security engagement. There will be multiple tasks during the event that will ask you to deploy the AttackBox.

You can deploy the AttackBox by clicking the "Start AttackBox" button at the top of this page.

![Start Attackbox button](https://tryhackme-images.s3.amazonaws.com/user-uploads/6228f0d4ca8e57005149c3e3/room-content/6228f0d4ca8e57005149c3e3-1763551029856.png)

Using the web-based AttackBox, you can complete exercises through your browser. If you're a regular user, you can deploy the AttackBox **for free for 1 hour a day.** If you're [subscribed](https://tryhackme.com/why-subscribe), you can deploy it for an unlimited amount of time!

Please note that you can use your own attacker machine instead of the AttackBox. In that case, you will need to connect using OpenVPN. Instructions on how to set up OpenVPN are [here](https://help.tryhackme.com/en/collections/3664918-openvpn-guide).

You can open the AttackBox full-screen view in a new tab using this button:

![The full screen button is located in the bottom left corner of the split screen window](https://tryhackme-images.s3.amazonaws.com/user-uploads/6228f0d4ca8e57005149c3e3/room-content/60909fb1f01099ca375e787ddc48789e.png)

**If the VM option is available:**

Most tasks in Advent of Cyber will have a virtual machine attached to them. You will use some of them as targets to train your offensive security skills and some of them as hosts for your analysis and investigations. If this option is available, you need to click the "Start Machine" button.

![Start machine button](https://tryhackme-images.s3.amazonaws.com/user-uploads/6228f0d4ca8e57005149c3e3/room-content/6228f0d4ca8e57005149c3e3-1763551072512.png)

After the machine is deployed, you will see a frame appear at the top of the room. It will display some important information, like the IP address of the target machine, as well as options to extend the machine's timer or terminate it.

![Active machine information](https://tryhackme-images.s3.amazonaws.com/user-uploads/6228f0d4ca8e57005149c3e3/room-content/6228f0d4ca8e57005149c3e3-1763551112625.png)

**If the split-screen option is available:**

Some tasks will allow you to view your deployed VM in a split-screen view. Typically, if this option is enabled, the split screen will open automatically. If it doesn't, you can click this button at the top of the page for the split screen to open.

![Show split view button](https://tryhackme-images.s3.amazonaws.com/user-uploads/6228f0d4ca8e57005149c3e3/room-content/6228f0d4ca8e57005149c3e3-1763551146629.png)

Please note that you can open split-screen virtual machines in another tab using this button:

![The full screen button is located in the bottom left corner of the split screen window](https://tryhackme-images.s3.amazonaws.com/user-uploads/6228f0d4ca8e57005149c3e3/room-content/38e87a57b989140607a374e7ee487f81.png)

**If there's a direct link available:**

Some virtual machines allow you to view the necessary content directly in another tab on your browser. In this case, you'll be able to see a link to the virtual machine directly in the task content.

![](https://tryhackme-images.s3.amazonaws.com/user-uploads/6228f0d4ca8e57005149c3e3/room-content/b0a5b7d20824326444979a77ff269b33.png)

Please note that for the link to work, you first need to deploy the virtual machine attached to the task.

**If there is a direct connection option available:**

Some tasks will allow you to connect to the virtual machines attached using RDP, SSH, or VNC. This is always optional, and virtual machines with this enabled will also be accessible via a split screen. In these cases, login credentials will be provided, like in the image below:

![Credentials](https://tryhackme-images.s3.amazonaws.com/user-uploads/6228f0d4ca8e57005149c3e3/room-content/6228f0d4ca8e57005149c3e3-1763551178426.png)

We provide this as some users might prefer to connect directly. However, please note that some tasks will deliberately have this option disabled. If no credentials are given, direct connection is not possible. Now that the admin is out of the way, are you ready to get warmed up for this year's event?

### Let's Get Warmed Up

The snow has started falling in **Wareville**, home of _The Best Festival Company (TBFC)_. The team is preparing for SOCMAS, the annual cyber celebration, but something’s not right. Systems are glitching, passwords are failing, and McSkidy suspects something is afoot. This name keeps coming up: **King Malhare**. What could it mean?

Before joining the **SOCMAS Response Team**, you can complete **10 short missions** to ensure you are ready. Each one teaches an essential cyber security skill and uncovers clues to help get you ready for Advent of Cyber 2025.

![McSkidy warming her hands by a fire](https://tryhackme-images.s3.amazonaws.com/user-uploads/6228f0d4ca8e57005149c3e3/room-content/6228f0d4ca8e57005149c3e3-1763127196624.png)
<div align="center">
<br>
<br>
</div>

### How it Works

To start each challenge, click the **“View Site”** button in the top-right corner of the task page. You’ll need to press this button **again for every new task**, as each one loads its own challenge site. Once clicked, the room will open in a **split-screen view**, letting you follow the instructions on the left while interacting with the challenge on the right. This is where you’ll complete all of our interactive challenges to get you ready for this year's event!

<div align="center">
<br>
<br>
</div>

### Password Pandemonium

As you log into your new TBFC workstation, an alert pops up:

“_Weak passwords detected on 73 TBFC accounts!_”

Even McSkidy’s password, `P@ssw0rd123`, has been flagged. Before gaining full access, you’ll need to prove your password prowess.

Strong passwords are one of the simplest yet most effective defences against cyber attacks.

**Objective:**  
Create a password that passes all system checks and isn’t found in the leaked password list.

**Steps:**
1. Enter a password with at least 12 characters.
2. Include uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and symbols.
3. Ensure it isn’t in the breach database.

<div align="center">
<br>
<br>
</div>

### The Suspicious Chocolate.exe

A shiny USB labelled **“SOCMAS Party Playlist”** appears on your desk. Inside is a mysterious file called `chocolate.exe`.  
It looks festive, but who sent it?

In this challenge, you’ll scan the file using a simulated VirusTotal tool to decide whether it’s safe or malicious.  
Checking suspicious files is a crucial skill for every defender.

**Objective:**  
Determine if `chocolate.exe` is safe or infected.

**Steps:**

1. Click the “Scan” Button.
    
2. Review the scan report (49 clean results, 1 malicious).
    
3. Decide correctly whether the file is safe or dangerous.
