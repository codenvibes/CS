## Introduction

Welcome to the¬†`Attacking Web Applications with Ffuf`¬†module!

There are many tools and methods to utilize for directory and parameter fuzzing/brute-forcing. In this module we will mainly focus on the¬†[ffuf](https://github.com/ffuf/ffuf)¬†tool for web fuzzing, as it is one of the most common and reliable tools available for web fuzzing.

The following topics will be discussed:

- Fuzzing for directories
- Fuzzing for files and extensions
- Identifying hidden vhosts
- Fuzzing for PHP parameters
- Fuzzing for parameter values

Tools like `ffuf` help us automatically test parts of a website to see what exists. For example, we can give it a list of possible page names, and it will try each one by sending a request to the website. If the website responds with a code 200 (which means "OK"), that tells us the page exists, and we can then check it out ourselves.

## Web Fuzzing

We will start by learning the basics of using¬†`ffuf`¬†to fuzz websites for directories. We run the exercise in the question below, and visit the URL it gives us, and we see the following website:

![[Pasted image 20250804191939.png]]

The website has no links to anything else, nor does it give us any information that can lead us to more pages. So, it looks like our only option is to '`fuzz`' the website.

### Fuzzing

==The term¬†DEF-fuzzing¬†refers to a testing technique that sends various types of user input to a certain interface to study how it would react==. If we were fuzzing for SQL injection vulnerabilities, we would be sending random special characters and seeing how the server would react. If we were fuzzing for a buffer overflow, we would be sending long strings and incrementing their length to see if and when the binary would break.

We usually utilize pre-defined wordlists of commonly used terms for each type of test for web fuzzing to see if the webserver would accept them. This is done because web servers do not usually provide a directory of all available links and domains (unless terribly configured), and so we would have to check for various links and see which ones return pages. For example, if we visit¬†[https://www.hackthebox.eu/doesnotexist](https://www.hackthebox.eu/doesnotexist), we would get an HTTP code¬†`404 Page Not Found`, and see the below page:

![404 error page with 'Are you lost?' message and 'Back to Home' button.](https://academy.hackthebox.com/storage/modules/54/web_fnb_HTB_404.jpg)

However, if we visit a page that exists, like¬†`/login`, we would get the login page and get an HTTP code¬†`200 OK`, and see the below page:
¬†
![Hack The Box logo with 'Login' text on dark background.](https://academy.hackthebox.com/storage/modules/54/web_fnb_HTB_login.jpg)

This is the basic idea behind web fuzzing for pages and directories. Still, we cannot do this manually, as it will take forever. This is why we have tools that do this automatically, efficiently, and very quickly. Such tools send hundreds of requests every second, study the response HTTP code, and determine whether the page exists or not. Thus, we can quickly determine what pages exist and then manually examine them to see their content.

<br>
</div>

### Wordlists

To determine which pages exist, we should have a wordlist containing commonly used words for web directories and pages, very similar to a¬†`Password Dictionary Attack`, which we will discuss later in the module. Though this will not reveal all pages under a specific website, as some pages are randomly named or use unique names, in general, this returns the majority of pages, reaching up to 90% success rate on some websites.

We will not have to reinvent the wheel by manually creating these wordlists, as great efforts have been made to search the web and determine the most commonly used words for each type of fuzzing. Some of the most commonly used wordlists can be found under the GitHub¬†[SecLists](https://github.com/danielmiessler/SecLists)¬†repository, which categorizes wordlists under various types of fuzzing, even including commonly used passwords, which we'll later utilize for Password Brute Forcing.

Within our PwnBox, we can find the entire¬†`SecLists`¬†repo available under¬†`/opt/useful/SecLists`. The specific wordlist we will be utilizing for pages and directory fuzzing is another commonly used wordlist called¬†`directory-list-2.3`, and it is available in various forms and sizes. We can find the one we will be using under:

```shell-session
codenvibes@htb[/htb]$ locate directory-list-2.3-small.txt

/opt/useful/seclists/Discovery/Web-Content/directory-list-2.3-small.txt
```

Tip: Taking a look at this wordlist we will notice that it contains copyright comments at the beginning, which can be considered as part of the wordlist and clutter the results. We can use the following in¬†`ffuf`¬†to get rid of these lines with the¬†`-ic`¬†flag.

<br>

## Directory Fuzzing

Now that we understand the concept of Web Fuzzing and know our wordlist, we should be ready to start using¬†`ffuf`¬†to find website directories.

### Ffuf

`Ffuf`¬†is pre-installed on your PwnBox instance. If you want to use it on your own machine, you can either use "`apt install ffuf -y`" or download it and use it from its¬†[GitHub Repo](https://github.com/ffuf/ffuf.git). As a new user of this tool, we will start by issuing the¬†`ffuf -h`¬†command to see how the tools can be used:

```shell-session
codenvibes@htb[/htb]$ ffuf -h

HTTP OPTIONS:
  -H               Header `"Name: Value"`, separated by colon. Multiple -H flags are accepted.
  -X               HTTP method to use (default: GET)
  -b               Cookie data `"NAME1=VALUE1; NAME2=VALUE2"` for copy as curl functionality.
  -d               POST data
  -recursion       Scan recursively. Only FUZZ keyword is supported, and URL (-u) has to end in it. (default: false)
  -recursion-depth Maximum recursion depth. (default: 0)
  -u               Target URL
...SNIP...

MATCHER OPTIONS:
  -mc              Match HTTP status codes, or "all" for everything. (default: 200,204,301,302,307,401,403)
  -ms              Match HTTP response size
...SNIP...

FILTER OPTIONS:
  -fc              Filter HTTP status codes from response. Comma separated list of codes and ranges
  -fs              Filter HTTP response size. Comma separated list of sizes and ranges
...SNIP...

INPUT OPTIONS:
...SNIP...
  -w               Wordlist file path and (optional) keyword separated by colon. eg. '/path/to/wordlist:KEYWORD'

OUTPUT OPTIONS:
  -o               Write output to file
...SNIP...

EXAMPLE USAGE:
  Fuzz file paths from wordlist.txt, match all responses but filter out those with content-size 42.
  Colored, verbose output.
    ffuf -w wordlist.txt -u https://example.org/FUZZ -mc all -fs 42 -c -v
...SNIP...
```

As we can see, the¬†`help`¬†output is quite large, so we only kept the options that may become relevant for us in this module.
<div align="center">
<br>
<br>
</div>

### Directory Fuzzing

As we can see from the example above, the main two options are¬†`-w`¬†for wordlists and¬†`-u`¬†for the URL. We can assign a wordlist to a keyword to refer to it where we want to fuzz. For example, we can pick our wordlist and assign the keyword¬†`FUZZ`¬†to it by adding¬†`:FUZZ`¬†after it:

```shell-session
codenvibes@htb[/htb]$ ffuf -w /opt/useful/seclists/Discovery/Web-Content/directory-list-2.3-small.txt:FUZZ
```
<div align="center">
<br>
<br>
‚Äª‚Äª‚Äª‚Äª‚Äª‚Äª‚Äª‚Äª‚Äª‚Äª‚Äª‚Äª‚Äª‚Äª‚Äª‚Äª‚Äª‚Äª‚Äª‚Äª‚Äª‚Äª‚Äª‚Äª
<br>
<br>
</div>

#### First: What is `ffuf` trying to do?

Imagine you're trying to find **hidden folders** on a website like:

```
http://example.com/admin
http://example.com/images
http://example.com/backup
```

You don‚Äôt know these folder names ahead of time. So you give `ffuf` a **wordlist** ‚Äî a list of guesses ‚Äî and tell it:

> ‚ÄúHey ffuf, try each of these words in the URL and tell me which ones work.‚Äù
<div align="center">
<br>
<br>
</div>

#### So where do keywords come in?

To make that work, `ffuf` needs:

1. ==The **list of words to try**==
2. ==The **place in the request to put those words**==

That‚Äôs what `-w` and `FUZZ` are for:
<div align="center">
<br>
<br>
</div>

#### Breaking down the command

```bash
ffuf -w wordlist.txt:FUZZ -u http://example.com/FUZZ
```

##### `-w wordlist.txt:FUZZ`

This tells `ffuf`:

> ‚ÄúUse this file (`wordlist.txt`) as the source of words. I‚Äôm calling this list `FUZZ`.‚Äù

If your wordlist looks like this:

```
admin
images
backup
```

Then `FUZZ` now means:  
üëâ Try "admin", then "images", then "backup".
<div align="center">
<br>
<br>
</div>

##### `-u http://example.com/FUZZ`

This tells `ffuf`:

> ‚ÄúPut each word from `FUZZ` **right here in the URL**.‚Äù

So ffuf makes requests like:

```
http://example.com/admin
http://example.com/images
http://example.com/backup
```

It checks if those pages exist. If one does, you‚Äôve found a hidden folder.
<div align="center">
<br>
<br>
</div>

#### Why is the path being "assigned"?

You‚Äôre **assigning a wordlist to a keyword** (`FUZZ`) so that `ffuf` knows:

- What words to try (`-w ...`)
- Where to try them (`-u ...FUZZ...`)
<div align="center">
<br>
<br>
</div>

#### Example without the keyword (FUZZ is the default)

This is also valid:

```bash
ffuf -w wordlist.txt -u http://example.com/FUZZ
```

Because if you don‚Äôt name the keyword (`:FUZZ`), ffuf assumes it's called `FUZZ`.

==But once you want to use **multiple wordlists in different parts** (like for file extensions or parameters), you'll need to name them:==

```bash
-w dirs.txt:DIR -w extensions.txt:EXT -u http://example.com/DIR.EXT
```
<div align="center">
<br>
<br>
‚Äª‚Äª‚Äª‚Äª‚Äª‚Äª‚Äª‚Äª‚Äª‚Äª‚Äª‚Äª‚Äª‚Äª‚Äª‚Äª‚Äª‚Äª‚Äª‚Äª‚Äª‚Äª‚Äª‚Äª
<br>
<br>
<br>
</div>

Next, as we want to be fuzzing for web directories, we can place the¬†`FUZZ`¬†keyword where the directory would be within our URL, with:

```shell-session
codenvibes@htb[/htb]$ ffuf -w <SNIP> -u http://SERVER_IP:PORT/FUZZ
```

Now, let's start our target in the question below and run our final command on it:

```shell-session
codenvibes@htb[/htb]$ ffuf -w /opt/useful/seclists/Discovery/Web-Content/directory-list-2.3-small.txt:FUZZ -u http://SERVER_IP:PORT/FUZZ

We see that¬†`ffuf`¬†tested for almost 90k URLs in less than 10 seconds. This speed may vary depending on your internet speed and ping if you used¬†`ffuf`¬†on your machine, but it should still be extremely fast.

We can even make it go faster if we are in a hurry by increasing the number of threads to 200, for example, with¬†`-t 200`, but this is not recommended, especially when used on a remote site, as it may disrupt it, and cause a¬†`Denial of Service`, or bring down your internet connection in severe cases. We do get a couple of hits, and we can visit one of them to verify that it exists:

![[Pasted image 20250805060116.png]]

We get an empty page, indicating that the directory does not have a dedicated page, but also shows that we do have access to it, as we do not get an HTTP code¬†`404 Not Found`¬†or¬†`403 Access Denied`. In the next section, we will look for pages under this directory to see whether it is really empty or has hidden files and pages.

## Page Fuzzing

We now understand the basic use of¬†`ffuf`¬†through the utilization of wordlists and keywords. Next, we will learn how to locate pages.

Note: We can spawn the same target from the previous section for this section's examples as well.
<div align="center">
<br>
<br>
</div>

### Extension Fuzzing

In the previous section, we found that we had access to¬†`/blog`, but the directory returned an empty page, and we cannot manually locate any links or pages. So, we will once again utilize web fuzzing to see if the directory contains any hidden pages. However, before we start, we must find out what types of pages the website uses, like¬†`.html`,¬†`.aspx`,¬†`.php`, or something else.

One common way to identify that is by finding the server type through the HTTP response headers and guessing the extension. For example, if the server is¬†`apache`, then it may be¬†`.php`, or if it was¬†`IIS`, then it could be¬†`.asp`¬†or¬†`.aspx`, and so on. This method is not very practical, though. So, we will again utilize¬†`ffuf`¬†to fuzz the extension, similar to how we fuzzed for directories. Instead of placing the¬†`FUZZ`¬†keyword where the directory name would be, we would place it where the extension would be¬†`.FUZZ`, and use a wordlist for common extensions. We can utilize the following wordlist in¬†`SecLists`¬†for extensions:

```shell-session
codenvibes@htb[/htb]$ ffuf -w /opt/useful/seclists/Discovery/Web-Content/web-extensions.txt:FUZZ <SNIP>
```

Before we start fuzzing, we must specify which file that extension would be at the end of! We can always use two wordlists and have a unique keyword for each, and then do¬†`FUZZ_1.FUZZ_2`¬†to fuzz for both. However, there is one file we can always find in most websites, which is¬†`index.*`, so we will use it as our file and fuzz extensions on it.

Note: The wordlist we chose already contains a dot (.), so we will not have to add the dot after "index" in our fuzzing.

Now, we can rerun our command, carefully placing our¬†`FUZZ`¬†keyword where the extension would be after¬†`index`:

```shell-session
codenvibes@htb[/htb]$ ffuf -w /opt/useful/seclists/Discovery/Web-Content/web-extensions.txt:FUZZ -u http://SERVER_IP:PORT/blog/indexFUZZ


        /'___\  /'___\           /'___\

We do get a couple of hits, but only¬†`.php`¬†gives us a response with code¬†`200`. Great! We now know that this website runs on¬†`PHP`¬†to start fuzzing for¬†`PHP`¬†files.
<div align="center">
<br>
<br>
</div>

### Page Fuzzing

We will now use the same concept of keywords we've been using with¬†`ffuf`, use¬†`.php`¬†as the extension, place our¬†`FUZZ`¬†keyword where the filename should be, and use the same wordlist we used for fuzzing directories:

```shell-session
codenvibes@htb[/htb]$ ffuf -w /opt/useful/seclists/Discovery/Web-Content/directory-list-2.3-small.txt:FUZZ -u http://SERVER_IP:PORT/blog/FUZZ.php

We get a couple of hits; both have an HTTP code 200, meaning we can access them. index.php has a size of 0, indicating that it is an empty page, while the other does not, which means that it has content. We can visit any of these pages to verify this:

## Recursive Fuzzing

So far, we have been fuzzing for directories, then going under these directories, and then fuzzing for files. However, if we had dozens of directories, each with their own subdirectories and files, this would take a very long time to complete. To be able to automate this, we will utilize what is known as¬†`recursive fuzzing`.
<div align="center">
<br>
<br>
</div>

### Recursive Flags

When we scan recursively, it automatically starts another scan under any newly identified directories that may have on their pages until it has fuzzed the main website and all of its subdirectories.

Some websites may have a big tree of sub-directories, like¬†`/login/user/content/uploads/...etc`, and this will expand the scanning tree and may take a very long time to scan them all. This is why it is always advised to specify a¬†`depth`¬†to our recursive scan, such that it will not scan directories that are deeper than that depth. Once we fuzz the first directories, we can then pick the most interesting directories and run another scan to direct our scan better.

In¬†`ffuf`, we can enable recursive scanning with the¬†`-recursion`¬†flag, and we can specify the depth with the¬†`-recursion-depth`¬†flag. If we specify¬†`-recursion-depth 1`, it will only fuzz the main directories and their direct sub-directories. If any sub-sub-directories are identified (like¬†`/login/user`, it will not fuzz them for pages). When using recursion in¬†`ffuf`, we can specify our extension with¬†`-e .php`

Note: we can still use `.php` as our page extension, as these extensions are usually site-wide.

Finally, we will also add the flag¬†`-v`¬†to output the full URLs. Otherwise, it may be difficult to tell which¬†`.php`¬†file lies under which directory.

</div>

### Recursive Scanning

Let us repeat the first command we used, add the recursion flags to it while specifying¬†`.php`¬†as our extension, and see what results we get:

```shell-session
codenvibes@htb[/htb]$ ffuf -w /opt/useful/seclists/Discovery/Web-Content/directory-list-2.3-small.txt:FUZZ -u http://SERVER_IP:PORT/FUZZ -recursion -recursion-depth 1 -e .php -v

```

As we can see this time, the scan took much longer, sent almost six times the number of requests, and the wordlist doubled in size (once with¬†`.php`¬†and once without). Still, we got a large number of results, including all the results we previously identified, all with a single line of command.

## DNS Records

Once we accessed the page under¬†`/blog`, we got a message saying¬†`Admin panel moved to academy.htb`. If we visit the website in our browser, we get¬†`can‚Äôt connect to the server at www.academy.htb`:

![[Pasted image 20250807135019.png]]

This is because the exercises we do are not public websites that can be accessed by anyone but local websites within HTB. Browsers only understand how to go to IPs, and if we provide them with a URL, they try to map the URL to an IP by looking into the local¬†`/etc/hosts`¬†file and the public DNS¬†`Domain Name System`. If the URL is not in either, it would not know how to connect to it.

If we visit the IP directly, the browser goes to that IP directly and knows how to connect to it. But in this case, we tell it to go to¬†`academy.htb`, so it looks into the local¬†`/etc/hosts`¬†file and doesn't find any mention of it. It asks the public DNS about it (such as Google's DNS¬†`8.8.8.8`) and does not find any mention of it, since it is not a public website, and eventually fails to connect. So, to connect to¬†`academy.htb`, we would have to add it to our¬†`/etc/hosts`¬†file. We can achieve that with the following command:

```shell-session
codenvibes@htb[/htb]$ sudo sh -c 'echo "SERVER_IP  academy.htb" >> /etc/hosts'
```

Now we can visit the website (don't forget to add the PORT in the URL) and see that we can reach the website:

![[Pasted image 20250807135404.png]]

However, we get the same website we got when we visit the IP directly, so¬†`academy.htb`¬†is the same domain we have been testing so far. We can verify that by visiting¬†`/blog/index.php`, and see that we can access the page.

When we run our tests on this IP, we did not find anything about¬†`admin`¬†or panels, even when we did a full¬†`recursive`¬†scan on our target.¬†`So, in this case, we start looking for sub-domains under '*.academy.htb' and see if we find anything, which is what we will attempt in the next section.`
