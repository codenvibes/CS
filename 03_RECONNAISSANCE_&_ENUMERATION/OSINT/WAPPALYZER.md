**Wappalyzer** is a popular tool (and browser extension) used to **identify the technologies** used by websites. It tells you what frameworks, programming languages, CMSs, eCommerce platforms, analytics tools, JavaScript libraries, server software, and more a website is using — just by scanning its public-facing code.

Yes! Wappalyzer only gathers publicly visible info. It doesn’t hack, scan ports, or probe servers — it just analyzes what’s served in the webpage code.
