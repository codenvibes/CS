**Wappalyzer** is a popular tool (and browser extension) used to **identify the technologies** used by websites. It tells you what frameworks, programming languages, CMSs, eCommerce platforms, analytics tools, JavaScript libraries, server software, and more a website is using — just by scanning its public-facing code.
