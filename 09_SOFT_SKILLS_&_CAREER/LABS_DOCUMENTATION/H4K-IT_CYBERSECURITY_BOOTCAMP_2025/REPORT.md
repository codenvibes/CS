# Introduction

The H4K-IT Bootcamp Capture the Flag (CTF) Challenge, held from **July 17 to July 19, 2025**, was a practical, hands-on cybersecurity competition tailored for participants of **Cohort 3** of the H4K-IT Cybersecurity Bootcamp. With **63 teams** participating, the event simulated real-world cyber threats, requiring players to apply offensive and defensive skills to solve a series of security-related challenges across various domains such as web exploitation, network forensics, cryptography, and reverse engineering.

This report documents my approach, methodologies, tools used, and key takeaways from the CTF. It aims to provide both a reflection of my problem-solving techniques and a technical breakdown of the challenges I tackled. Additionally, the report highlights how this CTF contributed to my growth as a cybersecurity practitioner, aligning with the bootcamp’s objective to produce industry-ready talent through immersive learning.
