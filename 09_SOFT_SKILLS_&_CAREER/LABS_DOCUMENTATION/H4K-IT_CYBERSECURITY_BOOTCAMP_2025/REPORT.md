Hi Sherry,

I hope you’re doing well! I’m currently participating in the H4K-IT Cybersecurity Bootcamp 2025 and just completed the CTF challenges.

I’m now working on my report and presentation and was wondering if you’d be open to sharing your past submission as a reference. I’d really appreciate any tips or pointers you can offer on structuring the report, what to emphasize, or even common mistakes to avoid.

Thanks in advance, and I completely understand if you’re unable to share. Looking forward to learning from your experience!

Best regards
Terrence
