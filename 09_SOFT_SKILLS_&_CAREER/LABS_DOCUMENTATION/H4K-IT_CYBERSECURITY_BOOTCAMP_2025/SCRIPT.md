### 🔹 Slide 1: Title Slide

**“Good afternoon everyone. My name is Terrence M.K., and this is my CTF Challenge Report from the 2025 H4K-IT Cybersecurity Bootcamp. Over the next few minutes, I’ll walk you through my experience, key challenges I tackled, lessons learned, and how this has shaped my journey as an aspiring cybersecurity analyst and cybersecurity enthusiast in general.”**

---

### 🔹 Slide 2: Introduction

**“The CTF ran from July 17th to 19th and It simulated attacks in web exploitation, pentesting, PPC code audits, OSINT, and forensics. My personal goal was to test everything I’ve learned in the bootcamp—to not only capture as many flags as possible, but also learn from every challenge, fail fast, and improve even faster.”**

---

### 🔹 Slide 3: My Profile

**“A little about me—as mentioned earlier I’m Terrence, a junior cybersecurity analyst deeply interested in offensive security, cloud security and hacking. I enjoy solving complex technical problems, especially when it comes to breaking and securing systems.”**

---

### 🔹 Slide 4: Categories & Tools Used – Domains

**“Next up I will discuss the the Categories & Tools I used in the mentioned domains of the CTF challenges. 
First the categories;
there were 5 key domains. 
Web Exploitation, Pentesting, Code Review (PPC), OSINT and Forensics.
Web Exploitation, involved IDOR, SSRF, and broken authentication exploits. 
Forensics had log analysis and memory inspection.
The Code Review tasks exposed flaws like race conditions and business logic bugs. 
And finally, Pentest—where I dealt with misconfigured SSH services and weak credentials.”**

---

### 🔹 Slide 5: Categories & Tools Used – Tools

**“To tackle these challenges in their respective domains, I relied on some essential tools: 
1st is the Chrome browser and Chrome DevTools for web analysis, 
2nd Gobuster and FFUF for fuzzing, 
3rd SSH and the Kali CLI for remote access, and 
finally Python3 for running code from the code review tasks
then curl, and Nmap for enumeration.”**

---

### 🔹 Slide 6–8: Challenge Summary

**“Now Let’s talk results.
I will give a quick rundown of the challenges I managed to solve.
I solved 24 major challenges. A few highlights:**

- **AI Solutions Portal**: IDOR via URL tampering.
    
- **CorpDocs**: Exposed admin panel via directory brute-forcing.
    
- **ResetRealm**: Predicted password reset tokens due to poor entropy.
    
- **ScriptServe**: Insecure file preview leaked sensitive data.
    
- **Transfer Us**: A critical race condition allowed double transfer of funds.
    

**Others like Pennies, Royalties, and The Puppetior showed how weak business logic can be just as dangerous as technical flaws.”**

### 🔹 Slide 9: Lessons Learned and Interests Ignited

**“This CTF sharpened my eyes for hidden flaws—especially in access control and race conditions. I learned that SSRF and upload validation can’t be taken lightly. The hands-on experience helped me connect the dots between theory and practice—especially when chaining multiple bugs for full exploitation.”**

---

### 🔹 Slide 10: Conclusion

**“This challenge was more than just a game. It gave me a real-world environment to test ideas, break things, and improve. It deepened my passion for ethical hacking and taught me to approach every system like a puzzle.**

**I’m incredibly grateful to the H4K-IT team for organizing such a transformative bootcamp, and to all the mentors whose feedback pushed me forward. I’m proud to be part of Cohort 3.”**

---

### 🔚 Final Slide: THE END!

**“Thank you for listening. I hope this inspired you to dive deeper into the world of ethical hacking—where curiosity is a skill and persistence is your superpower.”**
