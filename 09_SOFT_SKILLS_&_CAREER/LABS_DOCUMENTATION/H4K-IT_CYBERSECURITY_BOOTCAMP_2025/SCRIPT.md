### 🔹 Slide 1: Title Slide

**“Good afternoon everyone. My name is Terrence M.K., and this is my CTF Challenge Report from the 2025 H4K-IT Cybersecurity Bootcamp. Over the next few minutes, I’ll walk you through my experience, key challenges I tackled, lessons learned, and how this has shaped my journey as an aspiring cybersecurity analyst and cybersecurity enthusiast in general.”**

---

### 🔹 Slide 2: Introduction

**“The CTF ran from July 17th to 19th and It simulated attacks in web exploitation, pentesting, PPC code audits, OSINT, and forensics. My personal goal was to test everything I’ve learned in the bootcamp—to not only capture as many flags as possible, but also learn from every challenge, fail fast, and improve even faster.”**

---

### 🔹 Slide 3: My Profile

**“A little about me—I’m Terrence, a junior cybersecurity analyst deeply interested in offensive security and ethical hacking. I’m the guy people call when turning it off and on again doesn’t work anymore! But seriously, I enjoy solving complex technical problems, especially when it comes to breaking and securing systems.”**

---

### 🔹 Slide 4: Categories & Tools Used – Domains

**“The challenges spanned four key domains. First, Web Exploitation, which involved IDOR, SSRF, and broken auth. Then Forensics—log analysis and memory inspection. Code Review tasks exposed flaws like race conditions and business logic bugs. And finally, Pentest—where we dealt with misconfigured SSH services and weak credentials.”**

---

### 🔹 Slide 5: Categories & Tools Used – Tools

**“To tackle these, I relied on some essential tools: Chrome DevTools for web analysis, Gobuster and FFUF for fuzzing, SSH and Kali CLI for remote access, and scripting tools like Python, curl, and Nmap for automation and enumeration.”**

---

### 🔹 Slide 6–8: Challenge Summary

**“Let’s talk results. I solved 24 major challenges. A few highlights:**

- **AI Solutions Portal**: IDOR via URL tampering.
    
- **CorpDocs**: Exposed admin panel via directory brute-forcing.
    
- **ResetRealm**: Predicted password reset tokens due to poor entropy.
    
- **ScriptServe**: Insecure file preview leaked sensitive data.
    
- **Transfer Us**: A critical race condition allowed double transfer of funds.
    

**Others like Pennies, Royalties, and The Puppetior showed how weak business logic can be just as dangerous as technical flaws.”**

### 🔹 Slide 9: Lessons Learned and Interests Ignited

**“This CTF sharpened my eyes for hidden flaws—especially in access control and race conditions. I learned that SSRF and upload validation can’t be taken lightly. The hands-on experience helped me connect the dots between theory and practice—especially when chaining multiple bugs for full exploitation.”**

---

### 🔹 Slide 10: Conclusion

**“This challenge was more than just a game. It gave me a real-world environment to test ideas, break things, and improve. It deepened my passion for ethical hacking and taught me to approach every system like a puzzle.**

**I’m incredibly grateful to the H4K-IT team for organizing such a transformative bootcamp, and to all the mentors whose feedback pushed me forward. I’m proud to be part of Cohort 3.”**

### 🔚 Final Slide: THE END!

**“Thank you for listening. I hope this inspired you to dive deeper into the world of ethical hacking—where curiosity is a skill and persistence is your superpower.”**
