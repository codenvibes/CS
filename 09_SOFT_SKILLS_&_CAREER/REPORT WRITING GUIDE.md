Creating a strong cybersecurity report is not just about technical detail — it’s about **communicating impact clearly to all stakeholders**. This guide helps you write reports that are clear, credible, and management-friendly, while still preserving technical rigor.

## Structure Overview

Each report should include the following main sections:
1. **Executive Summary**
2. **Overview of the Assessment**
3. **Scope and Duration**
4. **Vulnerabilities and Recommendations**
5. **Closing**
6. **References**

---

## 1. Executive Summary _(for non-technical stakeholders)_

> **Goal:** Give a high-level, decision-ready summary.

- **Audience:** C-suite, managers, stakeholders.
- **What to include:**
    - What was tested (systems/applications).
    - Total vulnerabilities found, categorized by severity.
    - Most urgent issues to fix.
    - Business risk.
    - Optional: a bar chart showing severity distribution

## 2. Overview of the Assessment

> **Goal:** Briefly describe how the testing was performed.

- Summarize the methodology used (manual testing, tools like Nessus, Nmap, Burp Suite, etc.).
- State if it was black box, gray box, or white box testing.
- Highlight types of vulnerabilities targeted (e.g., IDOR, SSRF, race conditions, OSINT).

---

## 3. Scope and Duration

> **Goal:** Document authorization and testing boundaries.

- Systems/IPs/web apps tested
- Timeframe of the assessment
- Any exclusions or limitations

---

## 4. Vulnerabilities and Recommendations _(Main Body)_

> **Goal:** Present findings in a structured, digestible way.

### For Each Vulnerability:

- ✅ **6-word summary** (e.g., _Token tied to IP address_)
- ✅ **6-sentence non-technical explanation**:
    1. What was expected
    2. What actually happened
    3. How it was discovered
    4. Business impact
    5. Cost or risk level
    6. How to fix/prevent it
    
- 🔍 **Technical Breakdown** _(for technical readers)_:
    - Vulnerability Name
    - CVE (if applicable)
    - CVSS Score
    - Description
    - Tools/methods used to exploit
    - Proof of Concept (PoC)
    - Affected Systems
    - References
    - Remediation Steps
    
- 📊 **Graphic or screenshot** per vulnerability:
    - URL or form being tampered with
    - Before/after of a successful exploit
    - Visual attack flow

---

## 5. Closing

> **Goal:** Reinforce value and credibility.

- Recap key takeaways
- Emphasize lessons learned and how this strengthens security posture
- State intent to support remediation or follow-up

---

## 6. References

Include any materials referenced:
- CVE details
- OWASP documentation
- Hack The Box or TryHackMe learning material

Example:

```

OWASP IDOR: https://owasp.org/www-community/attacks/Insecure_Direct_Object_References
```

## 🔑 Soft Skills Emphasis

Soft skills in cybersecurity reporting are **critical**:

- Write clearly for mixed audiences (technical & non-technical)
- Prioritize readability and structure
- Translate complex issues into business impact
- Use visuals to aid storytelling
- Avoid dense jargon unless needed — then explain it simply
