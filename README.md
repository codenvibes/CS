# 🛡️ CYBERSECURITY LEARNING NOTES

This repository contains my structured notes from studying cybersecurity through platforms like **TryHackMe**, **Hack The Box (HTB)**, and other relevant resources. The goal is to consolidate and organize all concepts, tools, techniques, and learning paths in one place.

## 📚 Structure

The notes are organized into categories that reflect real-world cybersecurity domains:

- **Core Concepts** – Networking, OS fundamentals, scripting
- **Security Foundations** – Risk, threats, CIA triad, compliance
- **Reconnaissance & Enumeration** – OSINT, port scanning, service discovery
- **Exploitation Techniques** – Web app attacks, privilege escalation, buffer overflows
- **Defensive Security** – Firewalls, SIEM, detection strategies
- **Post-Exploitation & Lateral Movement** – Persistence, pivoting, credentials
- **Cryptography** – Hashing, encryption, encoding
- **Tools & Platforms** – Guides and usage for common security tools
- **Soft Skills & Career** – Reporting, interviews, and certification prep

> 🧠 Notes are updated daily/weekly based on my learning progress.
