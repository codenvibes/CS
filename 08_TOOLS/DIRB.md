## What is `dirb`?

**`dirb`** is a command-line web content scanner used to brute-force directories and files on a web server.  
It tries to find hidden or unlinked web resources by making HTTP requests using a wordlist.

## Installation

On **Kali Linux**, it‚Äôs usually pre-installed.  
If not, you can install it with:

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install dirb
```

---

## Basic syntax

```bash
dirb [URL] [wordlist]
```

**Example:**

```bash
dirb http://example.com /usr/share/wordlists/dirb/common.txt
```

---

## How it works

- `URL` ‚Äî The base URL to scan.
- `wordlist` ‚Äî A file with potential directory and file names.

If you omit the wordlist, `dirb` uses its default: `/usr/share/dirb/wordlists/common.txt`.

---

## ‚úÖ Example scan

```bash
dirb http://target.com
```

This runs with the default wordlist.

**Common locations for wordlists:**

- `/usr/share/wordlists/dirb/`
    
- `/usr/share/wordlists/` (look for `rockyou.txt` for passwords, `common.txt` for directories)

## ‚úÖ Useful options

|Option|What it does|
|---|---|
|`-o output.txt`|Save output to a file|
|`-r`|Don‚Äôt send the ‚ÄúReferer‚Äù header|
|`-S`|Silent mode (only shows found results)|
|`-X .php,.html`|Add file extensions to try|
|`-i`|Ignore case sensitivity|
|`-t 20`|Number of concurrent threads|

---

**Example with extensions:**

```bash
dirb http://target.com /usr/share/wordlists/dirb/common.txt -X .php,.bak,.txt
```

This tries each word with `.php`, `.bak`, `.txt`.

---

## ‚úÖ Good practice

üîí **Ethical note**:  
Only scan websites you own or have explicit permission to test. Unauthorized scanning is illegal.

---

## ‚úÖ Alternative tools

`dirb` is good but older ‚Äî alternatives like `gobuster` or `feroxbuster` are faster and support multi-threading better.

Example with **gobuster**:

```bash
gobuster dir -u http://target.com -w /usr/share/wordlists/dirb/common.txt
```

---

## ‚úÖ Tips for effective scans

- Try different wordlists (big ones like `SecLists`).
    
- Use extensions relevant to the target tech (`.php`, `.asp`, `.js`).
    
- Combine with manual analysis ‚Äî look at robots.txt or sitemap.xml.
    
- Respect server performance ‚Äî don‚Äôt hammer sites aggressively.
